1,BorisSoad,10,"I rarely give tens to mangas. But this one just deserves it! Why? I'm going to tell you: Monster isn't a tradional manga. It isn't about fighting. I even dare to say it is a 'Love it or hate it'-manga. If you are the type of Naruto and Bleach and looking for that kind of manga, this isn't the manga for you. If you are looking for an intense, well-written manga, I would recommend this certainly for you. The story is complex and long. Altough it's long, there isn't one single filler. It is all part of the same story. The story is about several characters, whomall have their own background and story. All the characters, you could just find them in real-life. And that is awesome. It all feels real and the flow of the story is... perfect.

The art was fine, although it isn't traditional drawn. Sometimes I thought the art was too unrealistic for the story. Some of the guys had way too big noses and stuff, but it wasn't really bothering though. 

I think it is hard to explain what is so perfect about this manga. The story is excellent, I think that is the main thing why I just like it so much. It is complex and intense, just like I said before. You will like the characters and follow their lives troughout the story. Tenma, the main character, goes from place to place and you get a peek into lives of other people. That is done so fantastic and real that you'll just start loving all those good people. 

The story is so complex, it left me with quite some questions. It is a manga in which not everything will be explained. You will have to live with that and make conclusion for your own. I didn't like that first, but now I realise it perhaps is just fine. The actions of humans aren't always explained in real-life either....

My conclusion: This manga is perfect for everyone who loves thrillers and tension! The 10 it has gotten from me, well, it just deserves it!",2009-01-24T03:43:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=11794
3,daimira,9,"20th Century Boys is about a group of men (and one woman) who, when they had been children, had been best friends, sharing a &quot;secret base&quot; in an overgrown field: a sanctuary where they could read manga, listen to music, and hide from the most evil twins in history, Yanbo and Mabo. One day, their &quot;creative genius,&quot; Kenji suggested they bury a time capsule, fill it with their treasured possessions, and agree to unearth it only when the earth was in grave danger, for they would then save it. Years later, they find themselves leading ordinary, unglamorous lives, their dreams of greatness long-buried under the dustof adult pragmatism. But then strange deaths caused by a mysterious virus begin occurring, and murders and disappearances occur one after another. Then one of their number becomes one of the dead, and all the clues point Kenji to a mysterious man who calls himself &amp;quot;Tomodachi (Friend),&amp;quot; who uses as his sign a symbol known only to Kenji's circle of friends.

As the scale of damage and the number of deaths rapidly increase, Kenji realizes that all the terrors are occurring as he had once set down on paper, in a story he and his friends had written, and buried in the time capsule they had sworn over.

20th Century Boys is difficult for me to summarize without giving too much away, but even if I were to divulge half of its secrets, we would still not be anywhere near solving the mystery of &amp;quot;Friend&amp;quot; and of his motives.

At first glance, 20thCB seems to be a crude shounen manga that would probably not appeal to everyone, judging by the artwork alone. But it is not. True, there are no pretty boys or girls to easily fangirl (or boy) over in this series, but this kind of story does not need exaggerated, surreal beauty in its artwork to survive. This truly is a graphic novel, where the plot moves with speed, certainty, and intelligence rather than rely on hundreds of feathers and cherry blossoms to depict angst and drama. The art is actually pretty polished as well, the inking clean and deliberate, and the panels arranged simply but effectively. Like movies these days, many manga artists tend to rely on &amp;quot;special effects&amp;quot; or glamorous art rather than plot to attract readers, but 20thCB has enough plot that any eye candy would just be a bonus.

Character development in 20thCB is also something I liked. Kenji grows and changes as the series progresses, and so do the other characters. The dynamics between the friends are believable, and their heroism so simple and understated.

I can't really find much to say about this manga, simply because it's so good and interesting and I probably wouldn't be able to do it much justice. But if you're looking for a fast-paced intelligent plot, masterfully created characters, and a mystery that can have you at the edge of your seat, then give this series a chance.",2007-08-16T09:54:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=721
4,TheCriticsClub,10,"Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou (abbreviated to YKK outside Japan) is an example of the proverbial “diamond in the coal mine”. Written and drawn by Ashinano Hitoshi, the manga was serialized in Kodansha's [b]Afternoon[/b] magazine for almost 12 years, and has gathered a number of devoted fans around the world despite the lack of licensed English translations. This comes as no surprise since it is one of the few series which deserves to be treated as a works of literature rather than of pop culture. YKK is a testament to the true potential of manga and the series is recognized as such, having been deemed worthy ofAfternoon magazine's Four Seasons Award for debut works as well as the 2007 Seiun Award for Best Science Fiction Manga.

[b]Story (9.7) &amp; Characters (10)[/b]

YKK is a science fiction story as it is set in a future after an unspecified large-scale disaster and the main character, Alpha Hatsuseno, is a robot who looks human. However, this is where any similarity to ""regular"" sci-fi ends. There are no spaceships, lasers, or mecha of any sort. Instead, older technology such as scooters, radios, propeller-driven aircrafts and the like, are very much still in use. This is reflective of the rural lifestyle that humanity has adopted in the story and adds to the easygoing pace of the manga. This tranquil, almost bittersweet feeling is reflected in the art style, the characters, and even the manner in which the story is delivered.

The story is told mainly from the perspective of Alpha Hatsuseno as she meets old friends, makes new ones, and casually explores the world around her. The most unusual fact about Alpha is that she isn't human, but a type A7M2 robot who looks human and is capable of feeling emotions. The story begins with Alpha taking a trip to Yokohama to buy coffee beans. She has been alone for some time as she waits for her ""owner"" to return from wherever he has disappeared to and, being immortal, she has decided that she can wait as long as it takes. In the meantime, she runs Café Alpha, a small coffee shop in the middle of nowhere which her owner left in her care.

Besides Alpha, several other characters also appear throughout the series. Some are shown regularly like Oji-san and his grandson Takahiro who run the gas station near the café. Others turn up less frequently such as the anonymous café customer and the mysterious Misago, an ageless wild woman who only appears before children. Next to Alpha, the other most prominently featured character is Kokone Takatsu, a type A7M3 robot. Kokone is effectively Alpha’s younger sister (production-wise that is), and as their friendship grows, she begins to develop romantic feelings for Alpha which later stir her curiosity about the history and nature of the A7 series.

Although the other characters do not enjoy as much exposure as Alpha does, several are given sufficient development to be memorable in their own right and their experiences serve as important reference points that highlight the passage of time. Through them, the reader is shown the great expanse of the story spanning the landscape and the era.

One of the most notable achievements of YKK is the manner in which the characters enhance each other throughout the series, and how Alpha gains a new perspective on life through her encounters with them. The interactions between the characters are often laconic and unhurried. Because of this, each encounter gains a languid, almost dreamlike quality that is far more memorable than what can be found in many other slice of life manga.

[b]Art (9.7)[/b]

The art in YKK contributes greatly to the relaxed atmosphere of the manga. Ashinano’s style is evocative of the simple yet fantastic nature of the world. In several parts of the manga, commonplace scenes are given an ethereal quality. This, together with the character designs and Ashinano’s unusual use of blank space, gives the art style a surreal characteristic that at times appears almost paradoxical. As with any long running series, the art style has evolved and improved over time.

Ashinano Hitoshi's character designs are perplexingly both spare and meticulous. Each character’s face is basic yet highly expressive; a stark contrast to their elegantly elaborate clothing and accoutrements. This unusual style is further enhanced by the picturesque backdrops and settings which the characters find themselves in. In addition to this, Ashinano has made wonderful use of blank space to emphasize the amount of detail in the characters and settings, something which is more prominently highlighted in the beautiful colored illustrations and panels that appear in the manga. This style of artwork focuses not only on the locations, but on the characters themselves and serves to enhance the reader's empathy towards each character.

From the most beautiful parts of nature to fantastic creations of Ashinano’s imagination (giant sunflowers, underwater streetlights, water gods, kamas, and many other wonders that Alpha discovers), each object and location in YKK helps to transport the reader more deeply into Alpha’s world. Not only is it easy to understand what she is feeling about her surroundings from the art alone, but the simple beauty serves as a way of deeply understanding not only the intricacies of her world, but of ours as well.

[b]Enjoyment (10)[/b]

Many readers have hailed YKK as the epitome of the slice of life genre and, given the premise, this may be no exaggeration. The series makes exceptional use of “mono no aware” (a Japanese term used to express the awareness of the transient nature of things, and the bittersweet sadness at their passing), and the time period in which the story is set makes the use of this especially poignant. In Alpha's words ""It looks like the twilight of this age has quietly arrived. I think I'll be around 'til these twilight years end.""

Reading YKK is without doubt one of the most unique and wonderful experiences in manga. Each chapter is filled with a calm, inviting feeling that pulls the reader into the story like a lucid dream. Alpha is without doubt one of the most engaging characters ever created, combining childlike innocence with reflective maturity. The story is remarkable in both its simplicity and its complexity as the reader is taken on a journey of discovery about themselves, the world around them, and the transient nature of things, whilst the art perfectly resonates with both of these elements to produce an atmosphere like no other.

Melancholy yet hopeful, exciting yet wistful, joyful yet sad, YKK is a singular achievement in manga that is deserving of the title ""Masterpiece"", and should be afforded a place amongst the great works of modern literature.

8,TrenchKamen,8,"Admittedly at first I expected this story to just be cute. Something light, something fluffy to &quot;baw&quot; at for a while. It is as sure as hell cute, but there is a hell of a lot more to this manga that initially meets the eye. For one, it's PAINFUL. For all that the ending feels a little deus ex machina, there is a lot that is not idealized. Suicide, death, and loss permeate the characters' lives. There is a focus on letting go of loss, on being held back by past tragedies, and having the courage to keep living when you have to reconcile that yourworst fears are, in fact, true, and are not going to change. Many of the characters have stopped LIVING because they do not want to let go of their pasts, and as Mitsuki discovers, the more you step forward, the more your past becomes detached from your heart. And it hurts, especially if that pain is the strongest link you have left.

At its core, this is a story about living one's life to the fullest and being willing to get go of the past for the sake of the future. Mitsuki gives the people around her, dead and live, the courage to let go of the tragedies chaining them to the past and move forward with their lives (or afterlives, as the case may be). Mitsuki's love for Eichi is heartbreaking, and anybody who has loved and lost has felt her gut-wrenching sorrow. This understanding of what she is going through makes her courage all the more remarkable.

I highly recommend this shoujo title to anybody who has ever known loss, who has ever wanted to give up, who has wanted to curl up in a ball and stop the world from turning while they stay in stasis. If you don't belong to that group, I have to wonder if you have experienced life yet.",2008-07-27T16:46:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=6631
9,Faeverily,10,"Tsubasa -RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE-, often shortened for the sake of convenience to ""Tsubasa"", is one of the newest additions to a large body of work by world-renowned manga studio CLAMP. After 6 years of faithfully following this series' serialization, I have come to the conclusion that it is nothing short of a masterpiece. ------------------------ ~STORY~: Tsubasa has an original and fresh story under its belt, which is to be expected from a CLAMP work. The main antagonist (Fei Wong Reed) causes a desert princess (Sakura) to lose all of her memories in order to achieve his dream. Her childhood friend (Syaoran) is forced to go to the Space-TimeWitch (Yuuko Ichihara) for help, because only through the Witch's powers can he be sent to different dimensions in order to retrieve Sakura's memories. He is, by a stroke of fate and unmistakable destiny, accompanied by a swordsman (Kurogane) trying to get back to his homeland and back to the princess whom he serves (Her Royal Highness Tsukuyomi). Syaoran is also accompanied by a secretive magician (Fay D. Fluorite) who is running from his mysterious past. However, to pay the price for traveling worlds, they must each pay with the thing they value the most. Syaoran loses his relationship with Sakura forever, Kurogane gives up his precious sword, and Fay parts with the tattoo which keeps his magic intact. Along the way, they encounter corrupt worlds full of war, despair, and lies. They find treachery and abandonment within their very own group. It's a story that sends a refreshing and ominous chill down your spine, especially in the second half of the series. The majority of the series is just savagely cruel..I'm warning you that Tsubasa steadily grows to be extremely dark and depressing. The story plays out to be more than worthy of Greek tragedy. It's a fool's game trying to predict how it ends. I definitely recommend this if you like magical adventures, fighting action, or forbidden romance.

------------------------
~APPEAL~: CLAMP excels at creating manga series that perfectly mesh the conventional attributes of shōnen and shōjo manga. Tsubasa is, like many of their works, a strong example of this. For guys, there are many badass, wondrously-illustrated fighting scenes, along with fantastic displays of weaponry in the splash pages and in the Infinity arc. The sheer amount of destructive chaos and spilled blood are enough to classify Tsubasa as a seinen manga. For girls, the romance genre will definitely pull them in. There are (literally) about 20 years' worth of crossover bishies who appear throughout the course of the series. Vampire Knight fans will be delighted at the appearance of vampires and their hunters in the Acid Tokyo arc. Shounen-ai fans will be wild over the boys' love teasing that CLAMP is renowned for, specifically interaction between Kurogane and Fay (what their relationship IS remains questionable, but has been addressed by editors at VIZ Media, prominent cartoonists, and professional manga critics). The hints of shounen-ai and minuscule doses of virginal eroticism are so specifically placed into subtext that it's enough to make anyone go crazy. Some worlds resemble feudal Japan, ancient Korea, Victorian London, and post-apocalyptic Tokyo, among others. Did I mention that there's clones, time-travel, and lucid dreaming? Yeah, this is a trippy manga. There's definitely something for everyone.

Tsubasa is, without a doubt, the most incredible and epic crossover series to date. It's not necessary to read CLAMP's other stuff, and it's perfectly all right to read Tsubasa by itself, but you will finish the series feeling empty inside. Let me warn you that you won't enjoy this manga nearly as much. Why read a crossover series if you don't know the true essence of the characters? Why read a crossover series if you are unable to understand the constant references, shout-outs, and cameos? If you are new to CLAMP, the fascinating charm of ""bringing back the characters"" has no effect on you whatsoever, and the magic of Tsubasa is altered in a very unfavorable way. All of their manga have been given such a unifying tone that you must read them to enjoy Tsubasa to the fullest extent. I honestly cannot stress this fact enough...the more CLAMP series you have read, the more you get out of the experience. Tsubasa was truly made for the fans who sobbed, bawled, and found themselves complete wrecks throughout the courses of RG Veda, Tokyo Babylon, X, and CLAMP's other tragic classics. I have emotionally invested all of my soul into these characters ever since I was a little girl, and to see them appear again at last was absolutely blissful. The least you can do is read Cardcaptor Sakura. If time is of the essence, you can always go straight to Tsubasa after CCS and then re-read Tsubasa later, after you've plown through all of their other works.

------------------------
~PLOT~: From the very start, Tsubasa grabs interest. However, the pacing begins to slow down due to filler chapters, repetitiveness, and childish innocence. I found it frankly a bit boring, but I didn't drop this series because...come on, it's CLAMP. A joke within the fandom is that anything and EVERYTHING by them will either develop into a dark, bloody, diabolically-slaughter-and-decapitate-every-living-thing-in-sight series, or into a disgustingly cute, fluffy, this'll-give-you-diabetes series. In this case, Tsubasa is leaning towards the former. I don’t argue with those who find the series weakening around the 10th/11th/12th volume mark, but just read a couple more and everything pays off.

At the Acid Tokyo arc, things begin to pick up with wicked plot twists being introduced left, right, and center. These 'twists' had been foreshadowed very frequently before in the storyline. Halfway through, the story takes on a distinctly darker flair, as bucketloads of blood and angst are suddenly deemed imperative. It's around this time that the series morphs from what used to be a light-hearted nakama adventure story to what TvTropes describes as ""something out of the drug-induced hallucination of a deranged Sigmund Freud."" From this point on, Tsubasa only gets more exhilarating with each successive installment. Lissa Patillo: ""You can certainly feel the excitement and suspense as the story is pulled along to dangerous, but enthralling, territory."" Some people have a preference for the first half of the series...when no one is dying, Syaoran and Sakura's personalities are yawn-worthy, and the plot lacks promise of depth. Hey, if that kind of stuff floats your boat, you shouldn't be reading CLAMP. They enjoy making their characters go through living hell. But they do this artfully. And they like to torture their readers.

Did I mention that every single time a new chapter came out, people would start panicking and screaming ""WTF?! I WAS WRONG!"" and then proceed to curse at CLAMP for unleashing yet another plot twist? I admit that even I felt frustrated, as the theories I took months to come up with were immediately disproven and dissolved with a mere statement in the manga. Don't even bother trying to come up with theories. To quote some of my friends: ""Even Einstein's brain would implode trying to understand the time paradoxes in this series. The plot's not just deep, it's BOTTOMLESS."" ""In fact, my brain expired three months ago."" ""Ohkawa has an even stranger mind than Salvador Dali, Quentin Tarantino and John Lennon put together."" The sheer number of storylines that come together will undoubtedly threaten your state of mental health, as they are very confusingly executed. Tsubasa begins to rely so heavily on symbolism that it can only be labeled a huge mind screw. However, CLAMP has been tying up all the loose ends in xxxHOLiC, and I applaud them from allowing the plot unfold at its own natural momentum.

There are still many unexplained questions about this series, but the vast majority of it makes sense if you have the patience to read xxxHOLiC, consider other fans' theories, re-read Tsubasa, and dive in a little bit on symbolism. All the true Tsubasa/CLAMP fans have already done this, while others start trashing this series simply because they lack the potential to understand it. You can't just skim through pages and expect to soak up all the information like a sponge. This is a manga that makes you think. This is a manga that forces you to come up with your own ideas and analyze subtext as you read. I'm quite sure that CLAMP will spoon-feed explanations to lazy fans in xxxHOLiC's ending, so make a note to check that out if the need arises. The two series intertwine very heavily, with emphasis placed on the later chapters. You'll gain an enormous amount of insight this way, and the majority of your questions will be answered.

------------------------
~ART~: Viciously gorgeous artwork, as expected from CLAMP. It's the typical highly detailed hair, heavily stylized eyes and human figures, and elaborate clothing which remains a unique style to them. Over time, the art gradually undergoes a dramatic transformation. The result is akin to that of X/1999. Tsubasa adopts a distinctly contrasting, black-and-white style, with the panels becoming more polished due to the heavy use of screentones.

Carlos Santos of ANN: ""What really matters—when two full pages are absolutely necessary to show how dramatic something is—the visual layouts nail it perfectly."" In fact, the most memorable scenes are the ones expressed entirely through art. Words mean nothing in this series...silence means everything. The sheer amount of raw emotion concentrated all into a single panel manages to hit you right in the heart. CLAMP knows their tragedy; they know how to reduce a hardcore fan to tears just by having them look at an isolated, wordless page. C.S.: ""Even plain old conversation scenes carry a sort of emotional magic, with bittersweet longing expressed on the faces of the characters as they ponder the changing bonds of friendship.""

C.S.: ""Raw penstrokes, gravity-defying angles and a bevy of special effects illuminate each fight scene. Thanks to the number of speedline intense, dialogue-scarce action panels ... don’t be surprised if you fly through this [series] quicker than most."" The backgrounds might even be too detailed, to the point where it's hard to see what's going on. All in all, the art translates effortlessly onto paper with the story's emotional, psychological, and tragic beauty. I can't praise it enough.

------------------------
~CHARACTER~: Subtext is huge in this category. Every single time I re-read Tsubasa, I discover something new about the characters. You have to let things sink in slowly, and ask yourself questions. ""Why did she decide to do that?"" ""Why did they exchange that look?"" ""What went through his mind when he closed his eyes in that panel?"" Tsubasa is the kind of manga that you can't read through quickly. You have to analyze and theorize. One of the main reasons that people give Tsubasa a low rating is because they aren't in tune with the characters and don't pay attention to the subtext. The subtle yet powerful looks on the character’s faces reveal everything you need to know. If you look hard enough, that is.

Syaoran, Sakura, Kurogane, and Fay have distinct personalities. They change tremendously. They lie and distance themselves from each other in a way that just breaks your heart. They find the meaning of true strength and break the chains that bind their pasts. They make horrible decisions and end up paying greatly for them. One thing that Yuuko said to Fai was, ""To all the young ones in your group, you are no longer someone who passes through their lives and is forgotten. You have become someone very important to them. Your hardships are their hardships too."" In short, our characters become extremely well-developed and have radically different ways of viewing the world as a whole. It's impossible not to relate to them, and you are dealt painful blows to the heart with the countless numbers of obstacles that are thrown between them. I would have liked a little more development for Syaoran and Sakura, though. Their love is too ""pure"" for me, and they're too kind-hearted for their own good. Kurogane and Fay are the ones that truly shine in this category. They're so human that it scares me to death. Lissa Pattillo couldn't have put it better: ""The whole [saga] tailors heavily to fans of character-relation dramas, as the connections between emotionally-scarred characters prove to be some of the most sweet, but also chilling, moments of [CLAMP] series in recent memory.""

------------------------
~OTHER~: This is a real treat for CLAMP fans. People who say that the creators were just lazy obviously aren't familiar with them. In a story where countless characters come and go, do you really expect that people will remember their names? What makes these characters memorable is the fact that their personalities and traits were unraveled when they were the main focus of a different series. The very roots of their hearts, or 'souls', are essentially the same. If you've read most of CLAMP's works, you know in exact detail the lives, true natures, and pasts of every single minor character in Tsubasa (in an alternate universe). It's nothing short of extraordinary. Like I sad before, I have been emotionally invested in all of CLAMP's characters, so to have them all again in this tragedy is almost sensory overload. I was struck with waves of nostalgia and a dizzying feeling.

------------------------
~ENJOYMENT~: I enjoyed Tsubasa tremendously, and am mourning over the fact that it has ended. It was a great 6 years, CLAMP. This manga is definitely worth your time. So why not give it a try? You certainly won't regret it. This metaphorical gem will stay lodged in your mind for a long time to come. A continued recommend read that I cannot stress enough the worth of sticking with.

------------------------
~FINAL VERDICT~: A great story, appeal for a wide range of audiences, absolutely breathtaking artwork, and good characterization make it a 'must-read' manga. However, the convoluted plot and the extremely depressing scenarios that occur in the second half of the manga will throw readers off-guard (though it's a wonderful improvement compared to the boring, comedic, ""gotta-catch-'em-all"" feel of the first half). The storyline gradually begins to make sense after months of ceaseless pondering, but once the majority of puzzle pieces are in place, you can't help but love Tsubasa even more. Definitely recommended if you're a CLAMP fan, but definitely NOT recommended if you've never touched any of their other series. All in all, I would rate this series a '9.5'. However, since there's no decimal rating available for reviews, I rounded it to '10'.

10,-redux,10,"There are very few mangas I give a complete 10 out of 10 for, but if anything, xxxHOLiC excels even at that- I would have given it a 100 out of 10 if possible. It's that delightful and amazing. xxxHolic is a supernatural story about a young teenager named Watanuki Kimihiro who is troubled by his ability to see spirits and his bloodline's inheritance of drawing them close to him. One day, when running away from the usual spirits, he enters a mysterious looking building, only to find that the spirits have vanished, and that the building is inhabited by a ""witch""- Yuuko Ichihara- who cangrant wishes. Watanuki wishes to be left alone by the troublesome spirits, but in return, must work at Yuuko's shop- a job that is like no other. Soon Watanuki finds himself learning more about the supernatural world, other dimensions, and stumbles upon two characters from a different universe: Sakura and Syaoran....

In a basic short: xxxHolic is not your typical run-of-the-mill manga. Exquisite in it's detailed art and subtle storytelling, this is manga at CLAMP's finest. Beginning with a series of ""events"" that Yuuko narrates and reveals something poignant about human nature and humanity and then slowly delving into Watanuki's mysteries and importance of being, it features excellent character depth and development. The chapters flow smoothly, going from one event to another without you really realizing it. It is slow at first, but in a good way, as it gives space for the characters to really develop and show their true colors. Eventually, it's crossovers with it's sister manga, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles, lead to a main focus around 100 chapters into the manga. Yuuko's exhilarating beauty, seductive and omnipotent nature with young ""apprentice"" Watanuki is a delightful relationship. Also featuring is a small main cast, and a small minor cast, which allows the manga to focus exclusively on these characters with respect and care, rather than going for halfhearted attempts to cover a large cast. The best thing about xxxHolic is that it is specified for those who like thought-provoking, philosophical manga that manages to be visceral and accessible. It is that quality which allows it to retain a sense of maturity and coherence which draws the reader in, while being relatively simple in plot for a good portion of the story.

Going onto specifics, however, the most wonderful aspect about this series, lies in its balance and characters. Roughly 1/3 of the manga devotes itself to episodic stories, each ending with a certain theme or saying, which may or not maybe as delightful as the viewer would wish to hear. It is here where we get a chockfull of comedy- from Watanuki's exaggerated emotions to Yuuko's fine palette and desire for food. It is here that unusually, we get the most amount of character development. Watanuki slowly transforms from a normal, spastic teenager to a more serious, refined and curious man. Yuuko herself changes- though more subtly, and as Watanuki begins to understand himself better, so do the people around him, and thus xxxHOLiC is really more of a character-based, introspective story than its sister, TRC, which is much more plot-based. 

The other 2/3 of the manga go into crossovers with the other series, which in a way is tragic, because in order to fully comprehend what's going on, you're going to inevitably have to read TRC or have a very good understanding of what's going on. That is one of the greatest weaknesses about this manga, one that has put many off from reading it, but let me say it now- don't let it get to you. If you prefer to read TRC - which has quite a long and convoluted plot - then that's totally fine, but the easiest way to understand these events is to simply read some general information about TRC (information that can  be obtained by going to WIkipedia, if you wish). It's also around this period that a dramatic shift in tone takes place- a very bold move, and honestly, what makes this manga fantastic in the first place. xxxHOLiC starts off as a comedy, but ends with a much darker atmosphere. It's here where Watanuki's character development really pays off, as we understand that in all things, not just wishes, just as there is a gain for something, there is also a price. Happiness is relative to everyone, and what may be one person's happiness may be another's misfortune. xxxHOLiC explores these themes and excellently, giving quite the realistic (but still with a hopeful edge to it) answers. 

Not only that, but lastly, xxxHOLiC is fantastic at giving the setting and characters life. No character feels completely flat and while some additional development could have been added, each character is different in their own way, and most importantly, the relationships between the characters are amazing. Each relationship shapes the character in a completely different way, and as Yuuko said herself- it are these ties that inevitably, make us want to wish, and make us human.

I'm probably ranting at this point at how amazing xxxHOLiC really is, but it changed my entire perspective and philosophy on life, and not many things can do that. A delight that anyone should definitely read, xxxHolic will have you most likely, hooked at first sight.",2011-09-06T16:16:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=42849
11,Kaiskov,3,"WARNING SPOILERS BELOW I can't believe this... I really can't believe this... Naruto is a manga that has been running for 15 years, I still remember catching up with the first seasons of the anime back when I was 12, I remember skipping the dreadful filler second half from the original series and going straight to Shippuuden, I remember ALL of it and it is suddenly over. Wow... feels like an entire era ending. Anyway, Naruto was one of the first anime series I have ever watched (Dragon Ball being my first), and even though I had lost my interest and enjoyment in it for a very longtime (I dropped it REALLY early when I had just started Shippuuden, it just wasn't doing it for me anymore), I still made an attempt at catching up with the manga because people told me it was ending and I wanted to see my late childhood fall apart just like that.

As for the actual review, Naruto started out as a fairly decent shounen manga, it told the story of a ninja called Naruto that was treated like shit by everyone else in the Hidden Leaf Village because he had the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed inside him. At first, he's completely useless and kinda annoying, all he really did at first was yelling ""I'M GONNA BECOME THE HOKAGE"" like if there was no tomorrow. And for those wondering, the Hokage is the ruler of the village.

He later teams up with two other classmates alongside a more experienced ninja and form a team that does the jobs assigned to them, while at the same time, each character has its own goals and intentions. The most notable, other than Naruto, is Sasuke, an old childhood rival that had lost his family when he was younger, eventually leading to him carefully planning to take revenge on the person behind it. At first, they do some stuff as a team and it is a fairly enjoyable story that does its job in a decent manner. Nothing too special, but also something that I could watch and still get a kick out of. Yes, Naruto was a bit annoying as a character, but that didn't keep him from being likeable, and the same goes for all the other characters.... at least for a while...

Eventually, Sasuke runs away and the story goes on a timeskip, which wasn't really a good idea as the story kinda jumped the shark at that point. Filled with asspulls such as the 99 different forms of the Rasengan and the treatment given to side characters, the story past the time skip had a MAJOR drop in quality, which caused me to eventually lose my interest in the series. Not to mention the treatment they gave to Sasuke, which initially was a character full of potential, only for it to be turned into the most despicable one of the cast that SOMEHOW still does a 180 on his mood. One second he is planning to destroy the village, the other he simply agrees to help Naruto defeat the big bad because.... crap, I don't even know anymore, I really think not even Kishimoto enjoyed what he was doing anymore at that point, just dragging the story more than it needed for the hell of it.

And Naruto himself did not get any better too, he was turned into one hell of a Mary Sue that just pulled random powers out of his arse because he had to defeat the evil villain at the end of the day. For crying out loud, even the worst Fairy Tail asspull is not as big as a lot of stuff I've seen here. I don't even think this was about bloody ninjas anymore because, as far as I'm aware, ninjas wouldn't just summon meteorites in a Final Fantasy manner. Eventually, even Naruto's iconic ""I'M GONNA BECOME THE HOKAGE"" was toned down and that's when I realized that these characters were no longer what they used to be. What about the rest of them? Pffffft, they were thrown to the side after the so notorious timeskip, it's like they weren't even there.

Another thing I have to point out is that the story simply couldn't keep one consistent bad guy. The timeskip arrives and we are left with Sasuke running away to eventually become a bad guy, a psychotic ninja that wants to achieve immortality and a secret society dedicated to capturing the Tailed Beasts such as Naruto's Nine-Tailed Fox. Wanna guess which one was the real big baddie? NONE OF THEM! Sasuke? He becomes a good guy after a while. Orochimaru? Same thing. Pain, the leader of Akatsuki? Turns out he was a puppet after all. Tobi, the guy behind him? Same thing, a puppet as well. Madara? Not this one either. Black Zetsu, the guy that never had any spotlight? Nope, also a puppet! As it turns out (And here comes a big spoiler), the real big bad just so happened to be the entity that created the energy force they use in their battles? How, because she was somehow resurrected...

Overall, Naruto is a manga that does a fair job on the first part, but completely blows it near the end. If you wanna know if it's worth reading? Not really, unless you are planning to stop just before the timeskip begins",2014-11-06T10:23:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=167609
12,infoworms,10,"Bleach is a truly cohesive work that plays to the strengths of the battle series genre with little fluff and fat. The characters are always moving forward, the story is engaging and iterates on itself smartly, it's constantly refining and executing on its themes, it's a near perfect showing of the battle genre. It pays off on investing in side characters, it rewards thinking about the themes and visual/textual metaphor with a deceptive amount of depth. It employs a mature cast and a strong grasp on real, tangibly complex emotion to great effect.",2020-12-31T21:09:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=371047
14,VK11,7,"When people hear the name Hiro Mashima today, they instantly think of his most recent work, Fairy Tail, which is steadily growing in popularity since its debut in 2006. However, its clearly easy to see where Fairy Tail's roots come from when one decides to undertake his previous, massive shounen story, Groove Adventure Rave. The anime adaptation of Groove Adventure Rave, named Rave Master, suffered considerably because of character designs that were not consistent with the manga counterpart, and because the anime adaptation covered only the first 90 chapters or so, leaving many unanswered questions and open plot holes. Groove Adventure Raveis a story that is unbelievably shounen, through and through.  However, despite obvious plot twists and predictable characters, it still does not take away on what turns out to be a highly enjoyable read about a teenager's coming of age journey to save the world.

Haru Glory, Rave's shounen hero, is a young teenager living away from civilization with his sister on Garage Island.  One day, an old man happens to pass through the Island and Haru eventually learns the identity of this old man is none other than the Rave Master, a hero that is destined to save the world from the atrocious organization, Demon Card, who plan on ruling the world.  The old man, in poor health, eventually passes on his title and sword to Haru, entrusting him to find the Rave Stones to stop Demon Card.  And thus Haru, becomes the 2nd Rave Master.  Early on in his journey, Haru meets a young girl, Elie, who has amnesia and is seeking the truth about her past.  This fateful meeting will eventually trigger events that become the foundation that eventually shakes the world.

From this synopsis, any reader familiar with shounen stories can get a sense of what kind of adventures, pitfalls, powers, themes, etc., Haru and Elie will encounter in their journey, and without fail, Mashima utilizes all of them.  The sudden power ups, the talk about dreams overpowering thirst for power, friendship overcoming critical death status, so on and so forth.  Groove Adventure Rave has all these shounen plot elements and in today's standards, the story starts to get pretty predictable as to what will occur.  Fortunately, there are a few plot twists that occur deep in the story which some readers will be surprised to learn about, and it are those saving graces which help keep the reader entertained.

Readers familiar with and fans of the art in Fairy Tail will easily come to love the art Mashima utilizes in Rave because its the same exact style.  While not as refined in the early chapters, Mashima designs his character rather attractively, the men with defined muscles and distinct faces; the women with heavenly chests and attractively looking figures.  The battles are rather easy to follow, however, there are some instances where things tend to get a bit cluttered.  The only critique I do have with his art is that Mashima does sacrifice detail in the background.  This is especially apparent during battles, where the background will either be plain white or black.  But again, this isn't too bad, as it does make the battles easier to follow.

While the characters look attractive, their personalities are rather predictable.  Meaning, Haru is your typical shounen male lead; Elie is your typical female co-lead, and the same with all of the other characters Mashima introduces.  They are nothing you haven't seen before, both good and evil.  On the other hand, Mashima is able to adequately tell the history's of each of his characters without taking up too many pages or chapters, which is a nice change of pace from other stories where character past's are either too long or too short.  Though character personalities really don't undergo a drastic overhaul from start to finish, all of the main heroes do evolve in a sense where you'll be able to pinpoint the difference from when a character was first introduced and where that character is during the last chapters.

Despite Groove Adventure Rave being the poster child for all things shounen, there is something about the story and the way Mashima goes about storytelling that makes it all seem enjoyable.  You actually start caring for what happens to Haru and Elie, and watch in awe as their relationship develops from acquaintances to love throughout the plot.  Mashima introduces a plethora of different characters that help shape all of the different arcs, and despite the length of the story, with the exception of a few gag chapters inserted in between, you never get the sense that Mashima doesn't know where he's going with the story.  Although the story does go from point A to point B without much deviation, it's still an enjoyable read.  

One of the big knocks I do have is the fact that almost every evil character, after being defeated, will undergo an instantaneous change from evil to good, which gets to be really old, really quick.  

After reading Groove Adventure Rave, its easy to see where many of the ideas, character and guild names arise in Fairy Tail.  All in all, if you're looking for a lengthy shounen, ""coming of age"" journey of a young man, with a nice side of romance, Groove Adventure Rave is something you'll definitely want to check out.",2009-06-26T08:51:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=16154
15,WrysOfTalys,10,"After 9 years, 38 volumes, and 355 chapters, Mahou Sensei Negima finally ends. Hereafter shortened to Negima!, this series is close to my heart because it's one of the very first titles I've ever read. I spend my first chapters of Negima! figuring out how the heck do non-Japanese readers manage to read from right to left. And now, nine years later, I've read several other titles. Every week or so, I eagerly await the coming of the next chapter of this series. I get impatient when Ken Akamatsu takes ""research breaks,"" or when it's a holiday in Japan (but I don't hold it againstthem, don't worry). To imagine the span of time it took for this series to finish, I was in the middle of first year high school when I started reading Negima!. (The series was just a bit past a hundred chapters back then) Here I am now, finishing my second year in college, and finishing Negima!.

I suppose I'll get to the sentiments later, and I'll start reviewing. Encompassing a series as big as Negima! in a single review will be challenging (it's the first big series I will review), but I will try my best to do it justice.

Story: 9/10

When you're talking about a series spanning 355 chapters, you'd only expect a story as excellent as it is detailed. When the said 355-chapter manga is labeled as a harem manga, you'd expect overextended story arcs with different girls. When it's also labeled as a fantasy manga, you'd expect overextended story arcs with different magical girls. Negima!, however, goes beyond what everyone expects of a harem manga (or a fantasy manga, for that matter). It's one of the best points of Negima!, so allow me to expand.

In a span of 355 chapters, Akamatsu has taken us to worlds we can only start to imagine: form an all-girls school, to areas reminiscent of the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in DragonBall, to flying machines, to magical worlds comparable (or even superior, depends on your opinion) to Hogwarts. The author has taken us all for a ride of epic proportions; while most titles stick to one story in a few fixed areas, Negima! takes us to the edges of reality. With gigantic floating library-chasms and the Red Planet all in the mix, Negima! is an imagination-inspired adventure all in itself. All these we explored because of a boy's undying dream of finding his father.

The story circles around Negi Springfield, a young boy who desires to emulate, and eventually locate, the Thousand Master (who is also his father). Simple as it may sound, the sentence above is the driving force of the entire story. Meeting his students, exploring worlds of magic and beyond--all this was due to his wanting of meeting his dad. It's amazing how such a simple thing can take a story to such great bounds.

It's also amazing how Ken Akamatsu manages to compress so much story details in a single, coherent flow of events. We have robots, mages, ghosts, Mars, teenage romance, and immortality all in one story. Having all this in a single story is already a feat in itself; to have extended it to 355 wonderfully-created chapters is something that so few mangakas have managed to do.

What prevented me from giving a 10 was the ending. Long as it is, the ending feels a little hurried. Don't let this stop you from reading, though: it's apparently designed as an open end. I guess it just happened so fast that I didn't feel enough sense of closure for the series. Either that or I was just rooting for one of the girls too much. I'm still hoping dearly for some sort of epilogue to answer all the hanging questions. For now, I will remain contented for what the ending brought me. After all, I expected ending a series this big to be challenging and hard. Akamatsu manages to do it well enough to give me a fleeting bittersweet aftertaste in my head; I'm both happy and sad that the series has ended.

Art: 9/10

I personally like clean art. Thick outlines, clean expressions and beautiful scenery keep me hooked on a series. Negima! manages to score this as well. Though not perfect, it's certainly enough to be worthy of praise. If you've read his previous work, Love Hina, and liked the art there, then you'll probably like the ones here too. It's nice to see how Akamatsu gives detail to facial expressions concerning blushing and all things related to love (trust me, you'll get it a lot here). His art style is also distinct; you'll spot his work right away. His art brings his characters to life--and seeing that his characters have so much visual detail in them, he certainly doesn't seem to hold back when it comes to making them look good.

Character: 10/10

Here's the other strong point of Negima!. Most mangakas avoid introducing too much characters in a story, so as not to get the readers cluttered in remembering who's who. Akamatsu, however, kickstarts Negima! by introducing a class of girls. Then he takes us to a magical world, and introduces even more. I haven't even mentioned the teachers in Mahora Academy yet.

Instead of being the weakness of Negima!, it is rather the strength of this series. Akamatsu-sensei manages to introduce characters with distinct personalites that characterize each one and each one alone (well, except for the twins in the said class). If you're going to do a harem, you have to give the girls distinction. If you'll do it with a class, you've got a lot of distinction to do. Akamatsu accomplishes this by two ways: personality and power. He gives each character a distinct habit or trait that is his or hers alone. Above that, he also gives them a unique power (this is a fantasy manga with mages, after all). And might I add that this was done excellently.

Enjoyment: 10/10

After everything that's happened, I find it hard to put the story of Negima! down. It's been an long, entertaining ride through the world of Mahora Academy and beyond, and it's been fun seeing a young boy grow up to become the great, respected mage he wanted to become, just like how much of a great mage his father was known to be. I spent a few minutes each week of these past few years reading Negima!, seeing the story progress bit by bit and seeing how Akamatsu gives life to characters both lovable and respectable. He manages to turn mere students of some girls' school to saviors of two worlds--both the human world and the magical world. Akamatsu also manages to make one heck of a good lead character. Negi looks like a boy (well, he is a young boy after all), but certainly acts like he's on a level well beyond himself. I'll be honest with you people, and say that I didn't feel like I was reading a harem manga at all; rather, it was more like reading a story of self-discovery and self-improvement. It's the story of a young Negi Springfield on a quest to find his beloved dad, and in the process he was finding out the good things he can do for the ones close to him. Likewise, his students find out there's much more to their cute little English teacher, and slowly (although Negi barely realizes this) the teacher himself teaches his students lessons well beyond English--in fact, well beyond school at its entirety. He slowly guides his students in find out who they are, and that they can be so much more than what they think themselves of.

I don't know how may readers managed to reach this part of my review, instead of just going TL;DR. My review is this long because I give Negima! this much praise and thanks as it gives us readers its last chapter. It was nice to see how each student ends up in the future, and it was certainly great to find out what the young mage manages to accomplish in the end. But beyond all awe for the characters, I find myself even more awestruck at how Ken Akamatsu delivers a story of epic proportions and manages to keep it as entertaining as it was when its first chapter was published. Alongside Ichigo 100%, this is one of my first mangas to ever read, and just now surely one of the first big series I managed to finish all the way to the end.

In the end, Mahou Sensei Negima! gives a permanent place for itself in the list of the great mangas of the decade. It's a bittersweet feeling to see it conclude, but all stories do end (even if they are open-ended). To end this review, I quote from the last page of the last chapter: 

""True magic results from courage of the heart. Boys and girls, be ambitious. One step can change the world.""

Congratulations to Ken Akamatsu for the nine years of success, and a big thank you to him for taking that one step, which in the end gives us a story that spans nine years and several worlds. I can now say that I grew up with Mahou Sensei Negima; even more, I proudly say that I saw it grow to become the great story that I thought it should become back when I read its first chapter.",2012-03-11T08:08:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=55753
16,Darvus_Laan,10,"I love this manga. It was my first read and is still at the top of my list. The artwork lent itself well to anime translation and the writing is outstanding. I really found myself wanting to learn more and more about each of the characters all the way down to the bit-players. Despite the violence inherent in their relationship, you can see very early on just how much Keitaro and Naru care for one another. Oh, come on...don't tell me you couldn't tell just looking at the covers! I could tell you the end and it'd still be worth reading. Don't worry, I won't...just sayin'. Ilove Akamatsu-san's attention to detail. He really takes the time to delve deeper into the supporting characters. Everyone gets a chance to tell their story and give you a glimpse into who they really are.

Loser or not, you gotta love Keitaro. Lady luck just had it in for him from day one it seems...he just can't get a break! Despite all that, he's a decent guy with strong morals and the biggest heart. Of all his shortcomings, he still comes through when it really counts and that's what matters.

I think what gets me is just how well Akamatsu-san conveys the emotions of the characters. Although first impressions give a good deal of information about each of them, they all grow and change over the course of the series and in the end...well, you'll just have to read it to find out.

I know plenty of people who would laugh at a nearly-30 straight male reading something like that, but I don't care. It's a great story, funny as hell, and it really connected with me. I even shed a few tears when...LOL...don't worry. I know better. Just read it, ok?

17,dazedqt23,10,"Kareshi Kanojo no Jijō (Kare Kano for short) is an amazing journey of a group of high schoolers with the main focus revolving around the power couple Soichiro Arima and Yukino Miyazawa. It is falsely advertised as a simple comedy/romance genre manga. There is so much more to the story, to be specific, there is a very dark side that makes the reader's heart wrench in pain as they watch the character struggle and grow. It has elements of psychological drama that are in line with stories such as ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World,"" ""School Days,"" ""Ef-A Tale of Memories,"" and ""ElfenLied.""

The anime/manga starts off very peaceful and it seems to be your typical comedy/romance.  I suggest you stay with the manga, don't drop it so easily.  It picks up it's pace...and at this point I will tell you how this manga made me feel, since I can't judge everyone's reaction... The story starts twisting and turning; as soon as you think something is solved, another situation pops up.  It all made me feel so anxious...I became addicted. The mangaka, Masami Tsuda does a great job developing the characters...she makes you fall in love with the characters.  In most other animes/manga, there is usually one character you yell at throughout the story.  Yet, in Kare Kano, right when you start questioning a character's intelligence, they surprise you.  Either they do what any sensible person should do (if they think about a situation calmly) or they reveal something that is so emotionally twisted that you can't blame them (or you just feel their pain so you sympathize).  Of course, there are characters I didn't like, but it never developed into straight up annoyance--I don't know, it was such an emotional rollercoaster.

IN CONCLUSION, this is a great manga that will take you on a journey.  It will make you laugh, cry, grin, hurt, hate, heal, and love.  If you really think about it, and draw some parallels between the story and real life, you may even discover something about yourself.  Maybe I am glorifying the manga a little too much...you should judge it for yourself, but you won't be able to do that unless you read it...so what are you waiting for?  Get started ^_^",2008-05-30T16:02:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5117
18,katsup,10,"After finishing this manga, I just had to write a review because there was none, and this is such a great manga! I tried my hardest to rate realistically, but in the end it didn't really work out. As always, I'm more critical with my explanations rather than my ratings. Story: So the story is about Sana Kurata, a famous child actress, and her relationship with Hayama Akito. At first she hates him because he is a trouble maker and cold, but over the course of the manga their relationship grows into a really deep conection. The story itself is a romantic comedy, with drama mixedin. It moves quickly but nothing feels left out or missing. There are many unexpected twists and turns that make it really exciting. It's really one of the best shoujo stories since it's not in any way a typical shoujo or idol manga. One of the reasons I loved this manga was because it stands out from others of the same genre.

Art: I am a huge fan of Miho Obana's art. Her art style is very &amp;quot;shoujo&amp;quot; so many characters do infact have the same style of eyes. However, she does a great job of expressing the emotions of the characters. I am bothered by the lack of definition in arms and legs (they're just like sticks), but that's not really unusual for the style, also they arent adults so it makes sense. For a manga of its time the art is very good, and of course the art gets better as the manga progresses, well.. a little bit.

Character: The characters are what make the story. Each character has a distinctive trait that makes him/her special. Sana is really hyper and says the weirdest things. Hayama is cold, says what's on his mind, and never ever smiles. Tsuyoshi is sweet and a pacifist, until he snaps and throws desks all over the room. Mama, Sana's mother, has crazy hairstyles and a squirell lives in it. I could keep going. However, aside from their quirky personalities, the character development over the manga series is great. No one is perfect, and this manga shows how a lot of the individuals may not be who everyone thinks they are. Sana is also not your typical heroine. She is not a crybaby who relies on her love interest. Instead she is hyper, dense, and always wants to do the right thing. The fact that the characters aren't extreme shoujo stereotypes made the story interesting.

Enjoyment: Yeah, if you can't tell by now I really enjoyed this series. There are lots of funny moments that made me laugh. But there are also really series moments that really surprised me! It's hard to put into words exactly why I enjoyed it, but I was not bored a single moment in this manga, even though I had seen the anime beforehand.

Overall: If you're a shoujo fan, you have got to read this manga. It's one of the most unique mangas I've read and it really is a great story. I would like to say that non-shoujo lovers would be able to enjoy it as well, because it's not all &amp;quot;lovey-dovey&amp;quot; like most. The romantic drama is secondary and is defenitely not the main focus. I highly encourage everyone to try it out.",2008-01-16T20:10:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=2010
19,yunfanz,10,ill skip the summery since we can all read the above. Anyways 10 out of 10 best manga series ive read. The story has many connections to real life it talked about the christian bible and jesus. It talked about the story of god and his archangels in one part. It made connections with world war 2 in another part. It even has the witch hunt and many others. The art work is very unique its not like a beautiful painting like in series such as ai yori aoshi but are very detailed sketches. Many of the setting are in slums and allyways that isvery hard to draw in detail and still he did an amazing work. The character are also top notch u have the two main characters Ginji and Ban. Ginji is ur tipical hero very friendly and always happy loves making friends however hes preaty stupid which actually makes him really popular to readers. Ban on the other hand is cool smart and above all cocky and arrogant. From my point of veiw ban is the coolest character ive seen in all the mangas ive read. A true god among man. To all those that saw the anime id say the manga is many times better.,2008-06-20T23:10:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5662
20,daimira,9,"As ancient Oriental board games go (no pun intended) Go, has a reputation for being either extremely boring, extremely difficult, extremely intense, or all of the above. It is not an easy game to play and a game is not easily finished, either. Yet Hikaru no Go, a manga that's all about Go and little else, made it seem exciting and interesting enough to stir some new-found appreciation for one of the oldest games around. Strange how action-packed manga rarely draw me in, but a manga about a board game (for crying out loud, a BOARD GAME!) can drive me nuts and leave me crying overcliffhangers. Each chapter is more fascinating than the last and if you find yourself saying &amp;quot;I'll stop reading after this chapter...No, after the next one...Damn it's a cliffhanger, I have to read the next volume...When it gets dark, I'll stop...I'll turn on the lights...&amp;quot; You probably won't rest until you've pretty much read all the volumes available to you.

Aside from the engaging story, the art by Obata Takeshi is also something to love. The art is simple, yet the crispness of the images lends a freshness. The inks are bold and striking - no swishy strands, frail noses, and feathers and cherry blossoms here. Everything is pretty much realistic. The details right down to the shoes are awesome. Seriously, I love Hikaru's outfits. He's like a Nike posterboy or something. Also, if you read the manga from volume 1 all the way to 20 in one go (again, no pun intended) you will notice something rather surprising. Hikaru grows up right before your very eyes. Literally. I have seen manga in which the storyline spans at least two years and yet the characters never change. But here, Hikaru grows taller, loses some of the baby fat, and Akari fills out. This attention to detail is really very interesting. About the only thing that remains the same on Shindou-kun is his hair - though it's shorter in the back in the later volumes. The art style also grows cleaner and the inking smoother as the series goes along, which shows that Hikaru isn't the only one whose style is growing and changing. Obata Takeshi's art, by the end of volume 23, is noticeably similar to his incredible work in Death Note and is a far cry from HikaGo's first volume.

However, the manga may not be for everyone. I admit that people who do not like wordy manga or manga with no action, magic or romance will probably not enjoy this very much. Still, if you want substance and realistic inner struggles without the excessive angst and hyperactive SD-ness (although there are still some of those), this is a good manga to read. It can appeal to anybody with even the tiniest bit of ambition, as that is ultimately what the story is about. Those who like comedy can enjoy this, too, as it doesn't take itself too seriously. It would be better if you have some small working knowledge of Go, so you might want to check the game out and play sometimes (though playing is likely to drive you even more nuts). Hopefully, Hikaru no Go will achieve one of its obvious goals - to reach out and make the youth (or anyone, really) interested in this difficult yet highly satisfying strategy game.",2007-11-15T23:55:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=1312
21,Xinil,9,"Alright, first let me say that, the manga is infinitely better than the anime. INFINITELY. But, with that being said, I believe the manga should have ended at chapter 58/59. After that, it's just a crapload of ""yeah-right"" and ""ooookay"" and ""bullshit"". Seriously, I hated the second half of the story. However, the first half was so ridiculously good, that I just couldn't give the manga a bad score. With that being said, on to the details. Story Brilliant. I can't think of anything else that has even come close to something like this. Entertaining, smart, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. You'll want toread the chapter after chapter to find out what happens next.

By far, the best part of this show. The characters were...alive. You felt like you really ""knew"" the people. Almost like reading a book there was so much detail. There aren't any that follow a typical ""stupid"" or ""cliche"" trademark either. Thank god.

Enjoyment
Well, as I said, I didn't enjoy the second half of the story. After the first half, my enjoyment level plummeted. Read the second half, if only just to say you have.

Overall
Do yourself a favor and stop after chapter 57-59. You'll enjoy the manga a lot more and probably be happy with a well thought out ending (as opposed to the chapter 108 thrown together ending).",2007-08-09T12:40:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=675
22,VK11,10,"As we move closer and closer to the next decade, it seems like we keep on getting farther and farther away from amazing samurai stories. With possibly the recent exemption of Samurai Champloo and Gintama (which, to be fair, aren't your typical Meiji era samurai story, there seems like an apparent lack of new series that features your traditional Japanese samurai. Well, new series that are actually entertaining and interesting to read. The mid-90's and the turn of the century saw the unveiling of many great series (most still ongoing) like Vagabond and Blade of the Immortal, which truly define and reallysets the standards of your traditional samurai story, though not your typical mainstream stuff.  That is where Rurouni Kenshin comes into play.  Nobuhiro Watsuki has really defined the standard of this genre, since his story was arguably the most mainstream and popular of the three.  With the anime receiving mixed reviews because of the mistreatment of its final season (which were all fillers), its important to go back to the original manga counterpart and review what exactly sets apart Rurouni Kenshin from other manga and anime, and really, why when people hear the name of this series, have the tendency to group it with the elite of japanese work.

We begin with the story.  Himura Kenshin, whose character is loosely based off a real life samurai during the Japanese Revolution back in the mid-1800's, is known as the dreaded Hitokiri Battousai and for some reason, he left the revolution halfway with a cross-shaped scar on his left cheek, a reverse-blade sword and a vow never to kill again.  Simply with this much information that is revealed at the beginning of the story, we get a sense that Kenshin's past must have been full of strife, hardship and events which turned him away from the life of a hitokiri to that of a wanderer (rurouni).  And simply put, that is where the broad story feeds off of.  As you begin to read the manga, you are unfolded to events which will reveal his past to you, all the way up to the final chapter.  Not only does this keep everything interesting, but it really gives you a chance to dive into the mind of Himura Kenshin and actually feel what he has felt, see what he has seen, and literally, witness Kenshin's developing character from start to finish.  Watsuki has almost flawlessly done this as advertised, with three main arcs to his story - the Tokyo arc, the Kyoto arc and the Jinchuu (Revenge) arc - the latter two really the main players in defining this series.

Another feature that gets easily overlooked in Watsuki's legendary story is the art.  I feel when people look at manga as a whole, they look at all the obvious elements of plot, character, etc., but a major categoy that is a factor in the enjoyment score is how well has the series been drawn.  Is it consistent?  How detailed?  And most importantly, do I actually know what the hell is going on, especially during battles?  Each of these questions are answered positively in the art as the character models and designs do stay consistent with the mid-1800 feel and culture.  The environments, though not intricately as designed as other series, do hold up in its own right, but prevent that ""outsanding"" score.  And the nice part with Rurouni Kenshin is that Watsuki has done a decent good job in drawing the flow of battles to the point where you're not questioning yourself what just happened.  Although, some of the sword techniques some characters have will make you stare at the page and be like, ""is that even physically possible?""

The character development of Himura Kenshin really comes alive through his dialogue and interactions with the other characters.  Well, one might think, ""of course this would be the case,"" but the fact of the matter is that most of the characters that you witness this kind of relationship all have some vendetta or hatred against the Battousai, which makes it all the more interesting to see how Kenshin goes about putting to rest not only these characters, but also his inner hitokiri self.  And for as much as these characters bring out the worst in him, it is evenly balanced with his daily, ever growing relationship with Kaoru Kamiya.  These interesting character relations and interactions are augmented prodigiously during the Kyoto and Jinchuu arcs, where you get to see the other, more deadly, side of Kenshin for the first time.  I will say that some of the characters will make you question what exactly was the manga-ka thinking when he created them, but after watching them in battle, it'll be a simply afterthought.

Witnessing Kenshin go through all these ordeals is what really makes the manga so interesting.  With his belief and vow of never to kill again, you really wonder sometimes if he is able to keep it, as there are many circumstances which really push Kenshin's psyche to the limit and even at times, his hitokiri side is unveiled.  This is really, in my eyes, what makes the story so enjoyable to read.  Every avenue of Kenshin's past, present and future is explored in heavy detail, leaving you with a fulfilled story, an actual complete ending and a truly satisfied feeling of nirvana (okay, maybe I'm stretching it a little bit), but you get the point.  To say the least, the story is captivating, especially if japanese samurai, traditional sword-style battles that don't drag on, are things you are looking for in a manga.",2008-03-08T08:38:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=2964
23,Bluegojoe,10,"Well Ranma 1/2 doesn't have a plot per say. It's more like a bunch of entertaining stories put together in the middle of a crazy scenario. However, that does not decrease the value of Ranma at all. It is a very good manga to pick up. Even considering the age and art style are quite different than most manga modern day. It is still very action packed and extremely hilarious. It happens to be one of my favorite manga of all time, just because the characters are all unique and funny. Just by reading Ranma you can discover the influence it has had onmany of todays manga. The stories aren't redundant and it very good read. In fact, I plan on reading the volumes multiple times. The action comedy romance is quite spectacular and unique to Ranma, unlike other series, it obtains a sense of originality that separates it from the rest and truly makes it great. Unfortunately, I don't which to spoil the series but all the twists and turns are funny and suprising that it will always make you have a &amp;quot;Laugh out Loud Moment&amp;quot;. The Protagonists and the supporting characters are all memorable and it really is a manga that is worth reading, even if it does not particularly have a plot. 

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO LIKES MARTIAL ARTS AND COMEDY! 
With a side of romance to boot, who would miss out on the opportunity to read this CHAOTIC AND SPECTACULAR MANGA!",2008-06-25T03:04:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5786
25,Archaeon,9,"One of the problems with something being truly good is that every so often it becomes a victim of its own success, and in a sense that's what happened with the fans of Full Metal Alchemist. Arakawa Hiromu's tale of two brothers and their adventures in alchemy is one of the most well known stories in anime and manga to date, and has spawned a horde of games, a movie (with a second one planned), numerous doujins and fanfics, piles of merchandise ranging from tatoos to chibi plushies, and two very different anime series. The story itself is very typically shounen at times, however there isa depth to proceedings that belies the initial look and feel of the manga. While things begin innocuously enough, it's not long before the reader finds themselves wrestling with moral, religious, and even philosophical motives and actions as the Elric brothers make their journey towards their destiny.

Enough waxing lyrical, on to the nitty gritty. Anyone familiar with Arakawa's other works, especially her one shot manga, will undoubtedly find some surprising similarities to certain events and situations that occur in Full Metal Alchemist. The reason for this is because Arakawa had the foresight to test out various ideas in another form and format before adapting them for use in her flagship title, and this refinement process shows throughout the story. Although this is a shounen tale in the truest sense, there's a degree of complexity and innovation which has been carefully applied in an effort to draw the reader in, and this is one of the hallmarks of Arakawa's storytelling style.

As with any work though, there are a few areas that could have been improved upon. In an effort to lighten the mood from time to time the mangaka has seen fit to apply a few doses of comedy here and there, and while stories like Raiden 18 make it clear that Arakawa has some skills in that department, the application of humour in Full Metal Alchemist is sometimes a bit haphazard. That said, it seems like the mangaka herself also had a similar realisation as the tone of the series becomes much more serious during the latter half, and the frequency of comedic moments drops quite sharply. Surprisingly, the humour is less of a distraction and more of an anodyne for the reader during the later stages of the story, which is a testament to the idea that ""less is more"".

The artwork is very typical of the mangaka, however once more there is that look of refinement about the characters and settings, and even some of the action sequences. One big plus is that the reader is given a more visual, and sometimes visceral, look into the author's world than one might find in other shounen manga. That said, Rumiko Takahashi's InuYasha is a serious contender in this department, but like that manga, Full Metal Alchemist also suffers from the same problem - the highly stylized characters.

The main issue with the design is that some people may find it doesn't suit their tastes, which will in turn impact upon their appreciation of the story. That said, as an advocate of more individualism in manga and anime, it's nice to read something that remains true to the author's style as there are far too many titles that look identical to each other (e.g. harem romantic comedies and about half of the shoujo manga out there).

As for the characters themselves, suffice to say that the development of the lead roles is very good indeed, and the supporting roles are given a healthy amount of space to shine as well. One of the more interesting aspects is the pace at which the characters are developed throughout the story, and a big plus is the degree of attention given to the ""bad guys"", especially later in the series. It's a sad fact that shounen tales are filled with shallow antagonists who serve no other purpose than to give the lead character a wall they must ""beat down"" in order to move the story forward, and while Full Metal Alchemist contains the basic elements of this type of progression, it manages to mask them far better than most action manga out there.

Is there a major downside then? Well, unfortunately there is, but it's one that's very much dependent on personal taste. The reason why the Full Metal Alchemist franchise is a victim of its own success is because of the original anime adaptation of the unfinished manga.

Now one of the problems that fans have is that the two versions of the tale are wildly different in terms of atmosphere, story and character mentality (basically they're like chalk and cheese). The main issue at hand is that while the manga version of Full Metal Alchemist is an excellent series, the original anime adaptation is becoming maligned and misunderstood because it deviates too much from Arakawa's story. Personally I consider both to be equally good, just not in the same way.

Here's what I mean.

Arakawa's manga is a very good story that incorporates a number of typical shounen aspects like never giving up, trusting in one's friends and allies, etc, and while the tale is excellent in both content and execution, in all honesty, it lacks a degree of ""darkness"" that was inherent in the first anime. One of the things that struck me about this dissonance was the fact that the whole theme of obsession seems to peter out by the end of the manga, whereas the first anime actually ended with that theme still running strong.

Now, some of you maybe a little confused by that perspective, especially as both tales feature the same characters to a degree, however one look at their respective endings will begin to make things a little clearer, and pay particular attention to Alphonse Elric as he is the reason why I consider the two tales to be so very different (and if you're still unsure, then feel free to ask me about it).

It's pretty obvious that I enjoyed Full Metal Alchemist immensely, however my only real gripe with the manga, especially after reading Arakawa's other works, is that there are too many occasions where it feels like the author has purposely moved away from a theme or situation that was used in the original anime, and this can make parts of the story feel a bit rushed. That said, this is actually a minor problem as the whole tale fits together extremely well, and in terms of content Full Metal Alchemist is easily on par with Takahashi Rumiko's masterpiece.

What Arakawa Hiromu has given us is a work that is truly good, despite some minor niggles here and there, and while there are some typically shounen aspects to the tale, Full Metal Alchemist, like Inuaysha, is a far cry from what one would consider a typical shounen manga.

Isn't it ironic then, that the two of greatest shounen tales weren't written by men?",2010-06-13T11:05:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=27112
28,RainSpirit,9,"NANA is definitely one of the best mangas that I've ever read. There's something about it that makes it very different from other ones, so I personally think it's a must-read. Anyways, my review may contain some spoilers, but I'll try my best not to reveal too much. Story- 10 The first thing that comes to mind when I think of NANA is how incredibly realistic it is compared to many other mangas. It starts out very normal like any other shoujo/josei manga; introducing the two main characters who both happen to have the name Nana. It pretty much follows the life of these two girls asthey meet on a train to Tokyo, and then later decide to share an apartment. It may sound a bit dull and boring, but the story always draws you in and makes you wonder what would happen next. Personally what I think is best about the story is the realistic aspect of it, since I've always loved serious and realistic mangas/animes. After reading so many silly mangas with unrealistic story plots, I found it very refreshing to read something completely different. In fact, it's so realistic to the point that I find myself wishing that it wouldn't be so realistic, since NANA definitely isn't your happily ever after story. 

Art- 7
Well, I hate to say this but the art of NANA isn't the best. It's not that the mangaka is a bad artist or anything, but the style of NANA just doesn't appeal to me very much. I also don't really like how some of the backgrounds seem as if they are a completely different style of art. Sometimes it looks as if the characters are standing in front of some wallpaper rather than in the actual place so that kinda bothers me. On the other hand, I love how much detail the mangaka puts in the characters and their clothes.

Character- 10
I'm not giving this section a 10 because I think all the characters are perfect and love them all to death, but rather because there is at least one thing I don't like about almost all the characters. That may sound weird, but the reason why I like it is because of how realistic it makes them and how it makes you able to relate to them very easily. I can easily imagine all the characters being real people, and almost all of them are very well developed. Another thing I like about the manga NANA is how the mangaka isn't afraid to put in traits like selfishness and possessiveness and have the characters realize those traits in themselves. I don't think I've ever read another manga that had that, so I was pretty impressed when I first read those parts.

Enjoyment- 9
I really don't have much to say here...all I have to say is that I thoroughly enjoyed reading this.

Overall- 9
Okay, I'll just be repeating myself here if I say how much I enjoyed it, so I'll just add a few things here that I didn't put up here. So another thing I like about NANA is how it makes you think a bit about life in general. The things that the characters say sometimes made me realize some stuff, and now because of NANA I think I can understand people a bit better. :3 

Recommendation-
I recommend this manga to people who like realistic plots that have a bit of humor in it. But if you're someone that likes fairy tail plots, happily ever afters, perfect princes/princesses, or couples that have no problems then this definitely isn't the manga for you. And it's also for an older audience so please don't read it if you're really young. o3o",2012-08-08T18:41:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=69145
29,SeerQueen,9,"Whenever I read &quot;Nana&quot; from manga-ka Ai Yazawa, I feel suckered into a world that, not only is fantastic, but is completely relatable... She has a knack for producing characters that are flawed, human. And make them likable... One doesn't realize the skill of an author so much when just given one example of their work, and, since I had only read the &quot;Nana&quot; manga (and absolutely love it, despite its flaws) I wasn't able to see just how good Ai Yazawa's pacing and storytelling can be... :) &quot;Paradise Kiss&quot;, an amalgamation of a love for fashion and love in general, is, as a whole, amuch better body of work than &amp;quot;Nana&amp;quot;. It works so much better because the author doesn't go off into tangents all the time. She focuses on the core group of characters, and builds up each of their stories. By the end of the five volumes you are left with a bittersweet, melancholy mood, haunting you long after you close the cover. You're left wondering just what will happen when such-and-such meet at such-and-such musical, or just what everyone will look like at such-and-such time...

Yazawa's art is just as stylish and edgy as in &amp;quot;Nana&amp;quot;, but with a higher concentration on fashion and &amp;quot;style&amp;quot;. It is a highly emotional story, full of the troubles associated with following your own path in life, and living accordingly. Yet, there is a self-awareness incorporated in it, with characters commenting about their presence in the storyline and whether or not there are enough pages for them. These comedic touches help the readers to not get bogged down in what could just be one angsty read. 

Also, the ending is perhaps one of the most realistic endings I have ever read in a manga. Whereas one expects it or wishes for something different, Yazawa captures the conflicting emotions of growing up well. And for this alone I can recommend it to anyone. It's just that, &amp;quot;Paradise Kiss&amp;quot; has many good things to base a recommendation :)",2008-06-22T23:46:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5706
30,fadinglotus,10,"""To make a friend's wish come true, we would do nothing less... And from the bottom of our hearts, we prayed for nothing more."" - from the most tear-jerking pages of Ouran Anyways, onto the actual review. Story (8/10) Ouran High School Host Club is about a normal girl, Fujioka Haruhi, who is admitted to a school (primarily for children of the upper class) on a special scholarship for being an excellent student. While looking for a place to study, she accidentally stumbles upon the Host Club (which is composed of six hot guys of the highest pedigree who cater to girls that have too much time on their hands)and is mistaken for a guy herself because of her shabby dress. When she accidentally breaks an expensive vase belonging to the Host Club, she is forced to work for the Host Club for the rest of her time in high school to pay off her debt.

In most shoujo romantic comedies, slowly but surely, all the guys fall in love with her and she picks the most unlikely one and they live happily ever after. The end.

Well, this isn't exactly the case with Ouran, mostly because our main character isn't looking for the guy of her dreams; she enrolled in Ouran because she wanted to become a lawyer. So, even though she's surrounded by a variety of guys and given the luxury to pick and choose, she doesn't give a damn about them. Frankly, she just wishes they'd all go away so she could study in quiet. And so, Haruhi's life at Ouran begins.

The Host Club's philosophy is to use everyone's unique talents to attract girls who all have their own preferences. There's Tamaki, the princely type, Kyouya, the cool type, Hikaru and Kaoru, the devilish type, Honey, the cute type, Mori, the silent type, and now Haruhi (actually a girl), the natural.

Now I'll have to admit, the manga has a lot of filler content (especially at the beginning where you're still being introduced to the characters), but once you get to know the characters well, you start to realize that the main characters are all very abnormal - as in, all their personalities are ridiculously warped and unrealistic in some way. Why? Well, the brilliance of this manga lies in the journey that the author takes you on to find out. 

Art (8/10)

I've got nothing special to say about the art. Bisco Hatori's style isn't very unique, nor is it totally amazing. I will say that the art significantly improves throughout the manga, and by the end, you could almost say that it is noteworthy, but overall, I wouldn't say the art is a main selling point for this manga.

Character (10/10)

If I could, I would rate this section a 13/10. The characters are very likeable, but most importantly, they are portrayed brilliantly. There is a diverse range of personalities and any reader will easily find one to his/her liking. However, the best things about the characters are, without a doubt, their backstories. In this manga, there's always more than meets the eye. Like I said earlier, as you start reading, you'll find that all of members of the Host Club (well maybe except Mori) have ridiculously warped and unrealistic personalities, but if you think about it, what could six hot guys from rich families possibly worry about? 

You have Tamaki Suoh, a charming guy with a flamboyant personality who simply strikes you as shallow and annoying, and then you have his unlikely best friend, Kyouya Ootori, a cold and calculating genius who puts on a mask of perfection to hide his insecurities. You are also introduced to the twins, Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, the sons of a famous fashion designer who love to play pranks on everyone. And of course, there's got to be that really cute 12th grader, Mitsukuni Haninozuka (a.k.a. Honey), who is addicted to sweets of all kinds and also a karate master despite his small stature, and his strong and silent sidekick, Takashi Morinozuka (a.k.a. Mori), who is ironically three times taller than him.

As you find out more about them and how they became the person they are today, I will guarantee you: you will gasp, you will sympathize; you may even cry. Don't even give me the excuse of ""I have seen the anime so I know about all this already"" because the anime doesn't even begin to touch upon their heart-wrenching stories. Just read it and you will know what I mean.

Enjoyment (10/10)

If you're worrying about not being able to get through the fillers to enjoy the main story, don't. That narcisstic, obnoxious, self-indulgent idiot Tamaki will come to the rescue. His actions are always hilarious to look at and his comments are always ridiculously stupid. He's the comic relief of the manga, but by the same token, he's also the source of much of the story's angst.

If you're not a fan of his, then there's always the rest of the Host Club: when their diverse personalities interact, something's bound to go wrong. Or, there's Haruhi, who's always being made fun of because she doesn't know the customs of rich kids. All in all, the manga was very enjoyable.

Overall (10/10)

Overall, this is a wonderful piece. The ending was ridiculous though, but I suppose it is quite fitting of the Host Club, whose members have always been...well...ridiculous.",2011-12-03T16:22:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=48539
31,Emmychu,10,"My first review! Forgive me if I've given out easy 10's, but I really do feel this deserves it, at least in my opinion! I've read the manga, excluding a few chapters from 57 on that could not be found. I have to say, I was completely hooked. Really, I never read a lot of strictly romance. Sure this is comedy, but it has no other plot than the relationships between the characters. Usually, this style of anime could really fly off course. But Lovely Complex was really great! It's a character-driven series, and this time the characters are likable, or realistic. I watched the live actionmovie after I read the manga. It was a pretty faithful adaptation, and I did like the character choices a lot, and they did their best to depict the height differences between the two main characters. Otani was really adorable, and Risa was really crazy and generally awesome. However, I'm not used to watching Japanese movies or even dramas, and it was a little different for me. In a manga or anime, the characters can look a certain way, but when real people try to mimic anime, it can look a little fake. I really enjoyed it, still, despite the fact that they had to cut some parts out due to length. It really was cute.

I've only just started the anime. I did like it, the style and presentation in up my alley, but I am disappointed after reading the manga. It progresses way too fast for me to be comfortable. It's great for me, since I already love the characters from the manga, but if I hadn't of read it, I don't think I'd be very attached to them! So, if you plan on getting into the series, or already are, make sure to read the manga! It's long and really satisfying, but it doesn't drag on.

__STORY__
I really like the story. Too many romances about one person having a complex (which is never a complex, just moe of some sort) and liking a person. Bleh. Lovely Complex presents two characters who have identical complexes, and the growing relationship between them as they battle to overcome their problems. I really liked it a lot, and I enjoyed that the characters had complex feelings. It never was like they had one pure emotion, they had feelings mixed in which made it really realistic and enjoyable. A very nice story to me.

__ART__
I'm a fan of the style. Nothing completely unique as far as I'm concerned, but truly great presentation. It's not really notable, but it would've been easy to mess it up, so the artist deserves props!

__CHARACTER__
The best aspect, because their is no plot that involves a magical girl transforming and having to keep her identity from her crush. It's just straight character development, through and through character-driven. It's really wonderful, you grow attached to every character, even minor ones who don't appear much after their introduction. You end up liking the characters so much, and seeing them as realistic people, that you don't complain when they make a stupid decision, because it's 'what a person in that situation would do'.


I really love the series, I never want to finish it! Once I finish the anime, what will fill the Love*Com hole in my heart? WHAT, I SAY?!",2008-12-29T16:05:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=10784
32,EmeraldWolfChild,10,"666Satan. When you first see that name you probably expect something really gory and R+ rated or something that you think will be totally NOT worth reading. How wrong you are....And let me tell you hat changed my mind :] Story: Something quite captivating; the whole O-Parts concept,the other path of evolution and the Kabblah really are something different than what you usually read. Not too long and drawn out, the story is just the right size even having enough room for 3 time period looks( which all look awesome on the characters). The only thing that put me off was the clumped together information/ battles. Maybe it's just a pet peeve but it slightly bothered me not seeing main characters for 3-4 (50 page long) chapters. Other than that, the plot really carries a deep meaning, sprinkled with those values that make us all go &amp;quot;Awww&amp;quot;.The story is a 9.

Art: A lot of arguments can be brought up here as the style is VERY similar to that of Naruto. Yet you cannot call it a copy as in some parts it's actually better than Masashi's (I personaly think Seishi's post time-skip characters in some parts are superior to Masashi's). Anyway, the style fits the story like a glove on a hand. What made me from giving it a 10 was the sometimes corseness of the art, especially at the beginning. Other than that, in my opinion, it's actually a refreshing change compared to pretty-eyed, stylish and deatailed manga. You feel the rawness of power and action through the art and that draws out the full enjoyment. A 9.

 Character: The strongest point in the manga, supporting the story 120% and fullfilling the arts expectations. All the characters have different pasts that are very often entertwined with others. All of them hold their own unique personalities and you can get a lot of enjoyment from any of them. This is probably the only manga where I don't have a hated(or deeply disliked) character. All of them show something to the reader and character interactions are simpy superb! The way they develop thoughout the story is also very believable and fitting so I think if you enjoy having a hard time choosing a favourite from a favourite, you should choose these guys. They deserve a 10!

Enjoyment: When sitting down to a chapter, you can feel the impatience bubbling inside of you, waiting to see what will happen next. And that is rightly so! I enjoyed many of the Ruby/Jio interactions (proabably 'cause I'm a romantic at heart), the O-Part battles, the steady unraveling of the plot. All of these factors made me read the story with feverish excitment and raised my enjoyment to one of the higest ones possible. I really got a full 10 out of the manga.

Overall: A manga worth the time and money. A bit of effort might be necessary to get into it (not to mention the english name isn't exactly flattering) but when you finaly get drawn into the story, it'll be very hard to withdraw. Shonen, Action, Supernatural, Spiritual and people can argue but I decide that there is definite Romance, this is a manga you really should pick up if you have the chance. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!

Thank you for reading my review and hope that you will read the manga if you have the chance! I hope it has been helpful!",2008-03-11T14:47:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=3038
33,ilhoon,9,"Kotarou Higuchi is a young boy with a lot of troubles. His mother died when he was young, his father is absent a large portion of the time due to work, leaving Kotarou to take care of things around the apartment they live in and, on top of that, he's not the best student and has to study hard just to get average marks - but wait! One day a mysterious girl claiming to be an angel moves in next door and won't leave him alone... You know, to be honest, Pita Ten has what sounds like an extremely typical plot. In shounen series featuringmagical girls this is usually the sort of situation you find, with very little variance from there on out. But Pita-ten is an exception. While the story may start out typically, later on in the series it evolves into a much more serious tone that questions the roles people have in our lives, how death affects people, and what the true essence of human nature is. Simple things like character quirks turn out to come from past traumas, and characters that would be nothing but jokes in other stories turn out to have surprising depth.

The art is by Koge Donbo, which, in my opinion, almost instantly means it will be remarkable. The character designs are all very cute, if not original. Still there are almost no points in the series where the art is anything less than wonderful. Even when the characters are drawn more simply for humorous purposes, they succeed in looking cute, if nothing else. Koge Donbo doesn't quite have a perfect or mature art style, but her style fits the story perfectly and only serves to make the series have its own character.

Character is another strong suit of the series that starts off seeming weaker than it actually is. While the characters we are initially faced with may come off as bland and prototypical at first, there is more than meets the eye with them. Even Misha, the heroine of the story, who is quirky and off-beat, has a backstory that explains many of her characteristics and actions throughout the story. The characterization of this series works because it deconstructs popular tropes of the genre all while serving to make the characters far less flat than they seemed to be originally. Furthermore, development is excellent as the characters grow up through the series both physically and symbolically. You really feel that they are learning and moving on towards the future, which is, in a way, the major theme of the story.

On a personal note, Pita Ten was the first manga I really read and bought all of the volumes of. I've sold most of my other manga series over the years, but Pita Ten is still on my bookshelf. Often times I go back and read a few chapters randomly, and a few times I've read the whole series in one sitting. It's the only series I do that with and it's because I enjoy it so much. Pita Ten starts out as a bit of a light-hearted manga with some romance, drama and comedy, but over the course of the series it begins to evolve to show you more and more of what's going on until everything is revealed to be completely different from your initial opinion. The first few volumes don't feel like much besides some laughs and a bit of budding romance, but they are fun to read. Past that things take a turn for the even better as the comedy and romantic elements become a bit less and the supernatural and drama pieces show up more and more, with the story improving because of it.

Overall, Pita Ten is the perfect antidote to your mediocre boy meets magical girl plot woes. The series takes this situation and runs with it, dragging you along to unexpected heights. With a cast you will learn to love, art that captures the spirit of the plot, and a story that's far more than it seems at the beginning, Pita Ten is a hidden gem in a genre that's often overlooked. Don't overlook this one, give it a chance, and find out the secrets of the angel who moved in next door.",2009-02-12T20:38:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=12384
35,Splitter,5,"After the wonderful time I had reading Pita Ten, I was compelled to seek out more of Koge Donbo's original work, so naturally moving down the line, I picked up Kamichama Karin. It started with all the best intentions; a comedically off-beat magical girl adventure... and then, dear reader, it slowly fell apart until there was nothing left to enjoy. Kamichama's biggest flaws come mostly from the story. While the offbeat humor fits in well in the first volumes, it becomes increasing inappropriate as a more serious plot is built upon. Most notably, the cast's antics and the slapstick humor feel severely out of place throughoutthe climactic volume, so much that I began to wonder if it was in Donbo-san's contract to write jokes for every chapter.

But that's small peanuts compared to where they really dropped the ball. Koge Donbo forgot how to write a plot twist. More to the point, Koge Donbo forgot how to write a plot twist until the final chapter and crammed 20 of them into 4 pages without any consequences or significance to the story. Now I can swallow a lot, but this was just too much. It defied the laws of realism established by the storyline. Because the manga had good buildup and was intriguing for it's longevity, I won't rate the story too poorly, but the last chapter was definitely enough to give it a 4.

The characters were not much better. Karin was a fun ditz for a few chapters, but she never... and I mean, NEVER grew past that stage. She is constantly irritating, has an annoying way of speaking, and generally has nothing that redeems herself of her flaws. Rather than a main character, she is toted around by the manga-ka as a love interest whose only ability is to be ditzy, cute, and eventually nab her man. I'm serious she does nothing else.

Other characters were either incredibly flat, completely unbelievable, or demanded more time be spent on them. Villains are sometimes treated with gravitas but most the conflicts are jokes. The characters are supposed to be in mortal danger but there is never a sense of that in their fighting. The only redeemable character in this mahou shoujo farce was Kirika, if only for offering a slight bit of depth and a generally compassionate role for the reader; a drastic change from the rest of the cut-and-dry cast

At this point, one would assume at least Koge Donbo's laudably adorable artwork would save this. From the first volume alone, you would guess right. Her trademark style leaves fits phenomenally with the story she's providing, even though her SD-drawing hasn't improved a scratch from her previous work. All goes well, but as the series hits its final stretch, the quality of the art takes a drastic nosedive and looks like that of an amateur dojinshi artist attempting to copy the manga-ka's style. It's downright embarrassing that a manga could provide such consistently wonderful A-ranked art for several chapters and then just bomb.

Now finally, I didn't hate Kamichama Karin in its entirety. The ending was horrible, and apparently there's a sequel but after all it pulled in the final chapters, I doubt I can bring myself to give it a look. For what it's worth, Koge Donbo sets up a fantastic story. It's not too dark, has a good amount of humor, and falls together quite nicely, but the rushjob finale and lack of gravitas to moments of drama bring the whole thing down more than I would have liked it to. If you're a fan of anything mahou shoujo, I'd recommend trying it, but don't expect too much from it, and don't expect anything from the ending.

Overall, I give Kamichama Karin a 5 out of 10.",2008-12-10T18:11:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=10280
36,Emiliebryhni,9,"So, Kamikaze Kaitou Jeanne? To be honest, i adored this manga, and I reckon it was a LOT better than the anime; concidering the plot was slightly different, I preffered the manga's plot. The story itself had me flowing tears the last couple of chapters, and I adored the &quot;happy ending&quot; {although... it... I dont know... it wasnt really THAT good an ending... if you only read until the last battle is finished... but I still adored it to bits}. I reckon it had a pretty unique, but not overly original, plot which a lot of people would enjoy ^^ Put probly girls more than boys...^^

The art is adorable, like all of this mangaka's art is. I dont know what more to say? Flowy hair and big eyes, I suppose =O Very very pretty =)

The character development is amazing {in my opinion}, you got to know pretty much all of the main characters past, and you get an explanation as to why they are the person they are in the present day. {Except for maybe the main character, who seems like the toughest person there... yet the one with the harshest past.} Still you get VERY attached to each and every character, and you start to understand what brings them all to do what they do because of how they are developed.

Overall, I really enjouyed this manga, and its a very good cry =3",2008-03-28T22:47:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=3455
37,FreedomWingz,10,"I loved this series~! Story: I thought the story was fairly original. It captured my attention because it was realistic. I could actually see how most of things would work in real life. The plot-line was intruiging and it wasn't really predictable. Some parts of it we're kind of clich&eacute; and predictable but most of it wasn't. Art: I love all of Arina Tanemura's art. Her art 's really detailed. You could see how all the folds in the clothes are realistic and I love the way she draws her eyes. The clothes are very pretty too! Character: The characters were interesting. Although it was kind of wierd with Maora andhim playing as a girl... The character's personalities were all different which made it interesting. A lot of them seemed to have split personalities too..

Enjoyment:
Shinshi Doumei Cross is definitely enjoyable. It was a bit of a cliffy at the end of every chapter which made you want to read more about. Sometimes due to not so great art, you'd want to quit reading but definitely not for this manga. The art's great and the story line is a real attention grabber.

Overall:
Overal, I thought it was pretty good. The ending was a bit wierd and a bit of a &amp;quot;typical Arina Tanemura ending&amp;quot;. It was slightly predictable at the end (although Haine's statement wasn't...) It left you wanting more. You wanted to find out what happened AFTER it ended.

I think this is Arina Tanemura's best work so far!",2008-06-15T17:05:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5513
38,sentiarii,10,"Ahh, +Anima. Half the readers probably stumbled upon this manga because its name is, alphabetically, one of the first to appear on a manga-hosting website.The other half probably just liked the word ""anima"" because it sounded pretty. Despite what coincidental ""methods"" we readers used to find it, +Anima was far from something meagerly amusing, and in fact, was engrossingly endearing in its own right. You can tell a professional storyteller from an amateur one, and Natsumi Mukai is by far the former. A story that's able to be told with stunning and consistent aesthetics, married with heartwarming character development and engaging subplots is difficult tofind. Look no further, however, because +Anima is one of the most underrated manga I've ever read (according to MAL scoring); I write this review on this sleepy Monday night to bring light to the wonderful +Anima.

STORY: 10
Some lump character development in the ""character"" section of reviews. I don't disagree that character development is related to the characters themselves. However, MANY stories convey the growth of characters as their means of storytelling. It's not something merely physical such as a journey (though that is the physical plotline of +Anima); story also includes the story of character growth and how their interactions change later on in the manga. Despite other reviewers' relatively lower scores of +Anima's story, I give it a well-deserved 10.

The premise is simple enough. You have children that have the ability to use physical traits of animals, be it because they've been forced to adapt to this ability or whether they're born that way. Cooro sets on a journey to find other +Anima and travel with them for no exact reason, other than perhaps an innocent ""because it's fun"" chain of thought. Given its somewhat linear overarching physical plot, it's deduced that this is a slice of life manga. Which is perfectly fine, but I'd have to disagree with other people giving the story a lower rating because of it. Stories don't need to be complicated to be wonderful; the purpose of telling +Anima's story is not to confuse readers or tell a save-the-world/damsel/treasure story, but rather portray the everyday lives of our party of +Anima.

""Given that it's a slice of life manga, how are the daily events of Cooro, Senri, Nana, and Husky, anyway?"" you may ask.

""Well,"" I answer, ""it's sweet, relatable, and shifts between fun and serious."" Some of the fun ones, such as Husky being mistaken as a mermaid later in the series by a young man, makes the corners of the reader's mouth daintily twitch up in amusement. Yet, there are also points of reflection and the subplots provide small tidbits of information on the characters and their pasts. The more serious stories, such as meeting Senri's tribe, heavily emphasize on the characters' pasts and why they've become whom they are today. It's difficult to convey the endearing moments in these events in this review, but each story provides a small moral or lesson that is IMPLICITLY (and I emphasize this word because there's just not enough IMPLICITNESS in manga) told to the reader, not shoved in our faces like a whole pie. Beautiful, beautiful storytelling. The daily lives of our protagonists are interesting and allow the reader to reflect upon common morals that we may or may not agree with.

ART: 10
Beautiful details. Intricately drawn backgrounds. It's not like your common shoujo with half-assed bubbles or flowers shown in the background when a character has her moment of pleasant surprise. Instead, these beautiful, lush backgrounds of the nature surrounding the party is depicted. And if it's not nature, it's the bustling towns that they move to and fro. Line art is well done -- bolder where emphasis should be and shyer where they're just small wrinkes in the clothing, etc. Given the age of this manga, the style of art has stood the test of time because the mangaka knew how to actually DRAW. As stated before in my review of He Dedicated to Roses, you'd be surprised at how many mangaka can't draw for the life of them despite the nature of their occupation. The characters' clothing designs are done extremely well; one look at a coloured (actually, it doesn't even have to be coloured) picture of Cooro and you can see the bright yellows contrasting the blues and reds, as well as the well laid-out, yet practical, layers of clothing he adorns. Wonderful work on the mangaka's part.

CHARACTER: 9
Despite the colourful cast of protagonists that most readers grow to love, there are several irking supporting characters within +Anima that were evidently not well-designed. Characters such as Fly could have had so much more done with them, but instead they're presented as rather 2D, especially in contrast to the well-designed +Anima protagonists we all know and  love (at least, I do anyway).

Even if the supporting characters fall short of what's ideal, the main party makes up more than enough for it. Each of the main party's members has a distinct feel to them. Cooro is playful, yet mysteriously obedient, and loves to eat; Husky is rather frugal, dislikes girls, yet looks like a girl himself; Senri... I'd have to be a little biased and say that he's my favourite character in the manga because there's so much to him (you'll love his absent-mindedness, his ability to spice up cooking, and his forgetfulness); and then there's Nana. Not particularly likable at the get-go, but later on she does learn her place and even Husky learns to tolerate her. Though these may sound stock characters to you, rest assured they're not; the mangaka uses tiny details in their actions and cleverly manipulates the dialogue to give colour to the characters.

ENJOYMENT: 9
It's a great read, but don't expect to finish it all in one or two go's. It's slice-of-life, and meant to be taken in small doses because it's calming and simply a pleasant read. Like Cooro and friends, just take a bit of time out of your daily life to read a little at a time, as reading +Anima could be a slice of your own life's events.

I couldn't give it a solid 10 because some of the events weren't consistently strong; however, they were all well-done. Some were simply better than others, and when compared, the reader wouldn't have the same gratification of reading some of the weaker stories.

OVERALL: 10
Terribly underrated series, and I suppose being a slice-of-life really can bring the story score down for certain reviewers. Don't treat it like a manga you can race through, because that's just simply not how you can enjoy +Anima. Read as much as you want, and stop when you feel you won't get any joy out of reading more. Then pick it up again, sprinkling it in the multiple slices of your own life to help sweeten a tame Sunday afternoon.",2010-03-01T20:47:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=23653
39,Qwerkzy,7,"Zombie Powder is a bit of a mixed bag. It's really impossible to not compare it to Bleach, since Zombie Powder was the mangaka's previous work (a relatively commercially unsuccessful one, I should probably add). It's probably not altogether fair to make the comparison, but it can't be helped since I already saw Bleach (both the anime and the manga) so I might as well just go ahead honestly with that perspective in mind. As far as art goes, it's very similar in style to Bleach-- good but not quite great. I would say that the mangaka's style hasn't really changedtoo much.

People who have read/seen Bleach will notice very obvious parallels between Ichigo and Gamma, both of which utilize ridiculously large swords and whose bodies contain some greater, dark being holding tremendous power.  Both of these darker sides are at once the protagonist and not, and you see Ichigo/Gamma noticeably suppress them.  There are some other character similarities (Inoue and &amp;quot;Wolfgangina&amp;quot; [&amp;lt;--- that really is her name, I'm not kidding] look very similar) but they're not quite as evident.  

The characters are fairly well developed, better so than in Bleach, if you only go up to volume 4 (the last volume in Zombie Powder) to be fair.  Some of the characters are pretty cool, my favorite of the bunch is probably CT Smith, a charismatic gunslinger who offers some of the best humor in the series.  The characters are a bit more balanced than in Bleach (where Ichigo is by far the strongest of the original team that went to Soul Society) and can take care of themselves fairly well without always having to rely on Gamma-- something I appreciate.  

In terms of settings, the Bleach and Zombie Powder universes are almost polar opposites.  Bleach is a supernatural Japanese universe complete with swords and spirits while Zombie Powder is a sci-fi Western (think cowboy movies w.r.t to the Western part) universe with guns and outlaws.  Between the two settings, I honestly prefer the supernatural Japanese one, although I will admit it is rather trite and Zombie Powder's setting is much more original (though it has a possible cousin in the form of Trigun).    

As Zombie Powder is an action manga, it would be a tremendous oversight to discuss it without mentioning a bit about the action scenes, which I think are fairly good.  They're actually quite similar to Bleach-- clean art, lots of plot twists in which it'll seem one guy is coming out on top but hey, go figure, he actually isn't, a generous helping of humor both during and between action scenes to keep the mood light.  Also lots of bizarre &amp;quot;special&amp;quot; attacks and villains, ranging from a crazy circus magician to a titanic fat woman.  It's a bit wacky, but if you've read the Bleach manga up to the latest chapters (with the rather bizarre and gruesome Szayel vs Mayuri fight) it's nothing you haven't seen before, anyway.

In conclusion, not a bad manga but I can't help but feel something is missing.  Maybe that is due to the fact that this manga never really ended, the mangaka stopped abruptly.  Maybe it's because some of the mechanics in the manga are a bit too similar to Bleach.  It might also be because of the really cliche premise of the story-- essentially a search for &amp;quot;Rings of the Dead&amp;quot; to construct Zombie Powder to gain immortality.  I think in the end, this was a worthwhile read for me, if only for historical purposes.  If you like Western settings in manga, or if you really liked Bleach a lot and would like to see a similar series, or hey if you just have some free time, maybe take a quick look at Zombie Powder and see if you like it.",2008-01-21T22:43:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=2092
40,Pyrefly,8,"Black Cat at its worst is a typical action manga chock-full of unoriginal characters and plot devices, but at its best an enjoyable series in which those unoriginal characters are endearing, the plot devices are familiar enough to seem almost nostalgic, and the story as a whole flows well (for the most part). Story: The core story is quite interesting, though it often takes the shonen staples of &quot;I'm gonna fight you just to prove myself&quot; and &quot;I suddenly got so much more powerful&quot; and &quot;I'm the only one that can stop the bad guy.&quot; The story is fun and even suspenseful beyond those occasional nuisances.Art: Black Cat also reminds the audience it's shonen by featuring a lot of guys with spiky hair. Train Heartnet's features are adorably catlike. In case you're not sure who to root for, the good guys look nice and bad guys are usually quite ugly. Nothing about the art itself really jumps out at the reader beyond some of the action sequences, which are nicely drawn. Unlike many other shonen, I actually found myself understanding what had just happened in any given fight.

Character: Characters are not this series' strong point, at least not as far as originality goes. Everyone has seen these characters before at some point, they just looked different and had different names. Train is your heartless assassin-turned all-around nice guy who is also a bounty hunter. Sven is the self-proclaimed gentleman sidekick with some kind of trump card in his fighting ability. Eve is the ridiculously powerful child who's been genetically altered and initially had no emotion. Creed is the guy who has a disturbing obsession with the main character and a vendetta against the world who inevitably decides to rule it over as a god.

That being said, the characters are faithful to their unoriginal archetypes. They rarely do anything unexpected, unless that's their intended personality. 

Enjoyment: In spite of the perceived recycled characters and storyline, Black Cat is quite enjoyable. There's plenty of humor interspersed throughout and the characters, to their credit, are diverse enough where a reader could pick one he/she really really likes and cheer them on over the course of the story. 

Overall: Black Cat is criticized for not being too original, but that's not really its intention. The idea is to create an interesting story with characters that have been tested and proven to work on an audience before, and besides, if Black Cat were to happen to be the first anime anyone saw, they wouldn't necessarily know the difference. This is, in the end, a worthwhile series for action fans.",2008-05-21T10:11:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=4869
41,Kyonkochan,10,"Story: While it may feel like a tired shonen plot to some viewers, Buso Renkin more then makes up for in pure fun. Never taking itself too seriously, as a good shonen should, the story is the lighthearted tale of a young boy who acquires powers and the responsibilities that come with them. Art: Perhaps the best part of Buso Renkin. The characters are drawn by the masterful Nabuhiro Watsuki of Ruruoni Kenishin fame. Anyone who knows of him knows of his strict adheerance to the Akira Toriyama doctrine of clean smooth characters and epic battles. Which I might add he delivers in plethora. Character: WHAT CHARACTERS!!!Tokiko is a refreshing take on the typical standby/do-nothing female love intrest we tend to find in shonen. Bravo is arguably one of the coolest mentors ever; need I say more then BRAVO SMILE? And last but not least... PAPPILON!!! Perhaps it's just me, but I always find these elegant posh type villains to be such great characters. Their complete and total narcisisistic nature and... *ahem* stylish choice of clothing make them quite enjoyable. Definetly Buso Renkin's strongest point.

Enjoyment: I have a hard time imagining anyone who couldn't enjoy this series. It's not overly long, has  enough story to keep things going, and genuinely interesting characters.

Overall: Buso Renkin is one of those magic hidden gems of the anime/manga world. Highly recomended for anyone not tottaly opposed to shonen, and well worth a look for the less enthusiatic.",2010-05-14T17:09:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=26054

43,Torisunanohokori,10,"Sports manga in general (with a few notable exceptions) branch off into two main groups - the martial group and the teamwork group. The martial sports manga (featuring boxing, judo, etc.) usually sport characters with grit and guts struggling against one another. This type of sports manga also often suffers from overemphasis of the main character and weak side characters who only serve to show how awesome the lead is by comparison. The teamwork sports manga (featuring baseball, basketball, etc.) usually sport a large, well-developed cast. At the very least, the main team of a team sports manga will havea lot of fleshed-out players.  The downside with teamwork sports manga is that it can sometimes feel like competition-lite, and it lacks the quantity of guts displayed in martial sports.

The American Football played in Eyeshield 21 is an interesting and ultimately successful combination of the two formulas, mixing the group dynamics of a genuine team with lots of hard-on action.

I have a lot of praise for the way the sport being played is used in ES21.  Football is a large sport, requiring 11 players on each side, each with a different distinct role.  As a result, you always have characters other than just the mains in play, being far from useless.  22 players, though, are a bit much to focus on at one time, and this manga acknowledges that, focusing only on small portions of the playing field at any given time.  We get lots of different individual, small group, and large group confrontations throughout any given game, which makes up for the fact that a game may go on for 20-30 chapters.  This effectively splits up screentime among a truly massive cast in a way which neither weakens the mains nor benches the non-mains.  The cast is, in addition to being in the triple-digits, extremely diverse backstory-wise, ranging from a kicker who quit his team to help his father's business to a tall reciever who's good and popular, but failing to catch up to the true genius superstar of his own team.  Odds are most, if not all, people will be able to find at least one character whose background they sympathize with.

And there are mindgames.  Dear me, the mindgames.  Possibly the best part of this manga is how the player confrontations are set up by a diabolical mastermind of a man, Hiruma Youichi, a gun nut with dirt on half the world's population.  This guy comes up with the most outlandish trick plays which are usually a surprise, totally outlandish, and always fun to watch.  What's more, they often don't work, giving an added thrill of uncertainty to each play.

The basic plot of Eyeshield itself is standard fare; weak, bullied kid (Sena Kobayakawa) with hidden talent gets forced into a sport and ends up liking it.  His team gets stronger with him in it and goes on to compete at high levels.  Just how high is a minor spoiler.  Two things here.  Firstly, you can expect the Devilbats to lose quite a bit, and not just in the introductory chapters to their eternal rival.  Secondly, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE BASIC FORMULA.  Just because it's common doesn't mean it's a weak one.  Coming-of-age stories have been selling since forever for a reason, and the basic formula needs only to be applied correctly to produce a decent piece.  High-schoolers passionately fighting tooth-and-nail over one inch of turf isn't going to get old anytime soon.

Not that Eyeshield is just decent - it's consistently hilarious, thrilling, and a whole lot of fun.  I would recommend trying it out to just about anyone, including the people who aren't normally predisposed towards manga.  It's a shining example of what sports shonen, and shonen in general, can be when it tries.",2009-06-12T14:18:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=15701
44,Tumppiman1,10,"I have never written an review for any anime or manga before, but I absolutely had to make the exception for Gintama. (I apologize if my English is not perfect before hand...) It always feels so much easier to start series that have only 12 volumes or episodes. I have always personally stayed away from the longer running shows, as I have thought for them to be a waste of time, when I could finish 20 or more series in their time. Gintama truly showed me how wrong I was about how I thought. Gintama does not only have the most colorful and large cast of charactersbut an overall interesting story and rich world. Whilst the series does seem quite innocent type of comedy manga for quite a few chapters, Sorachi does show later on his clear talent to write good action packed shonen too.  What I feel like I should specially praise is how Gintoki Sakata is like, as he is far from what you would think an average anime role model or shonen hero is like. Whilst other protagonist's do have their bad sides too to make them seem more human and bad at something, Gintoki  is instead the last person you should take model after.  In other words, a drunken broke mess of an man. Still, Gintoki manages to be the most human than any other character I have seen, whilst still influencing everyone's lives around him. 

The overall score for the story from me is easily a 10. Giving any less would feel wrong. Each chapter, no matter if it was an stand alone story or part of an long going arch felt special. All of the chapters gave you an interesting, thrilling and absolutely chaotic dumb experience, that made me laugh, cry and face palm with the characters time and time over.  Some of the side stories felt more stupid than I could tell, but they still tied up always well and felt like a good part of Gintama in the end. There was not a single chapter that felt like a bore to read.

For the art I would give  an good  9. I am not an pro when it comes to describing art, but I think Gintama had a beautiful style and nice warm feeling to it. The art style was able to make the world seem more alive and convey feelings well. Fight scenes were absolutely amazing through the art too to follow. 

As I stated before, I loved the characters of Gintama, so 10 is easily the right choice from me.  It is impressive for me how Gintama has so many characters with so many colorful personalities. Many other shorter and longer mangas/animes do not pull it as well as Gintama did. Still, what I appriciated more with the chars was that they could all go from 0 to 100 and backwards so fast. From an all super serious moment, things suddenly could turn full on comedic without making it feel too out of place, more like part of whom the characters were. 

What can I say for the enjoyment? I loved it. The comedy, the fights, sad parts and slight fan service. It all tied down well making the manga extremely enjoyable and fun to follow all the way from the beginning to the end. easy 10.

Overall score: 10  I would give Gintama even more, since the manga  has become a very close part of me. I loved it from the first chapter to the very last. Usually, at the end of such masterpieces, I would say that I'd feel incredibly empty, knowing that I won't be able to read or watch more of the characters adventures, but with Gintama, I feel extremely happy and fulfilled. I got so much good out of gintama and will keep praising it for all days to come. So, instead of being empty after reading  Gintama, I feel like I got my own silver lining to my soul. 

Thank you for the great journey odd jobs and the cheese cake, Sorachi.",2019-08-12T19:13:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=315208
45,Master10K,9,"Ichigo 100% is what you can call a classic Shounen, Harem, Ecchi, Romantic, Comedy manga having the typical set-up of, one ""loser-kun"" (Manaka Junpei) surrounded by gorgeous girls. It’s pretty easy to find this manga annoying, due to the dragged out storyline and loser protagonist but it’s just as easy to find it rather enjoyable, from the various potential relationships involved. The story starts of with our protagonist somehow ending up with the hottest girl in the school and this being a Shounen Rom/Com makes it acceptable. Now with the dumbest thing taken care of, from this point on the reader can enjoy a really longmanga full of clichés. Some points in the story are really dragged out, with no progression whatsoever, but the various themes (aspirations, movies, etc.) are what give Ichigo 100% a refreshing feel. The romantic element of the manga is pretty well done because the relationships the protagonist gets himself into are all different and somewhat believable (well half of them at least). One thing to enjoy about Ichigo 100% is how well it promotes speculation, because it isn’t certain who the indecisive protagonist would end up with.

When looking in the artwork it’s easy to see how average it looks in the beginning. Although as the manga progresses, so does the artwork, with some great character close-ups. Like in most Rom/Coms all the detail is put into the female character designs, which is really good when looking at their individual features and how it matches their varying personalities. Nonetheless the guys aren’t as important, with not as much detail put into them, though at least the mangaka did a good job in expressing the character’s emotions. Shame this is an ecchi manga, littered with ""panty shots"".

Overall this ecchi manga doesn’t stand out because of its artwork or story but rather how enjoyable it is to read, being the only reason why anyone would read all 19 Volumes. The likable characters and romantic developments are all the more reasons to think of this as one of the best harem manga of all time; however all the unnecessary clichés and panty shots may turn some people of. Well I personally loved this, which is why overall I would give it 10/10.

47,Izaya,10,"Ah, where shall I start with KHR? I was introduced to the franchise through the anime. When I realized the anime was cancelled, I finished the anime and then moved on to the manga. Every time I finished a chapter, the next one just got even better. I honestly enjoyed every moment of reading this. Story is flawless, ofc. The archetypes in the manga are just as perfect. The art is amazing. You can see she put her heart and soul into her drawings (esp in the Simon Arc and her drawings of Daemon Spade completely revived). Overall, I enjoyed this manga a lot. Hopefully, Akira will make anothermanga",2014-12-24T10:22:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=174045
48,Master10K,8,"Imagine being a guy that is involved in a horrific traffic accident. You wake up from a year long coma and everyone thinks your dead but what&rsquo;s worse is that you have a girl's face. That&rsquo;s the basic setting for this hilarious Gender Bender, Romantic, Comedy. The stupid story for Pretty Face started incredibly well, as most of the guys reading this will be able to understand how Randou (male protagonist) feels to be forced into this situation. After the initial beginning, the story just becomes a bunch of random events about Randou trying to keep his true identity hidden. This can be pretty difficult whenthere&amp;rsquo;s a worrisome thing between his legs and it leads to some absurd comedy.

The characters involved in the story are your typical batch that are found in certain shounen, romance manga but the one the stands out the most has to be Randou (Yuna). As a guy reading this, I could definitely understand how Randou must feel, being in these kinds of situations.

With a great story, great comedy and great characters this manga was somewhat let down by its mediocre artwork. When not much was happening it was okay however when there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of action, on a page, it can be a challenge to visualize the scene.

Overall Pretty Face proved to be a very enjoyable manga and is probably one of the best in the Gender Bender genre. No matter how unbelievable the story can get, it always does a good job making these seem convincing, like how only Randou&amp;rsquo;s face is a girl but the rest of the body is his. Well solely as a comedy this manga is a must read but like many other Rom/Coms, but the romance barely plays any part in the story.

49,worldstraveller,10,"well, the manga is the best I've read so far, completed. the development is very great, however not much development focus on the female character. and the author to me give me a lot of enjoyment, is so funny, there always the drama, the spirit team always present, and so touching, exciting, can be even thrilling and I'm not a fan and usually don't like sports neither sports anime and manga, and this one, for some reason is special and so different.",2008-09-14T12:05:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=7936
50,StaminaRose,8,"I enjoyed this manga quite a bit. Its essentially the typical shonen manga, with little to differentiate it. What i enjoyed was the bizarre undercurrent of evil it seemed to have at times. From an almost necrophillic doctor whos implied to be addicted to Morphine to a boy quite obviously named for a drug ( Lyseig Diethel named for Lysergic Acid Diethylamide respectively) I also found many moments to be extremely emotional and touching, wihlst the characters were well characterised and varied, each with their own personalities aims and backstories, some of them just tragic (especially that Doctor). The characters come from various countries and ethinicities,which makes a good change from casts inexplicably scattered across the world yet all japanese. Theres English, Chinese, African-American etc. its nice. Best of all, the villain to this piece is a marked change from most villains and a breath of fresh air against the common evil to everything type you get in some manga. 

So if your bored and want to read another shonen manga, i would suggest this over most others.",2009-07-07T14:02:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=16548
51,kuglefang,10,"Slam Dunk is probably the best manga ever published and the anime version is one of the best I have ever seen. Even though the series has ended more than a decade ago, many people wiill wholeheartedly agree that this franchise has stood the test of time. The story is simple but the execution is incredible, each chapter is filled with humor, action, drama, comedy and a whole lot more. The anime series was good and worthy of being considered a landmark anime, but if you have yet to see the anime then you don't know what you're missing. However there are things thatare not shown in the anime series which is why it is crucial for you to read this manga. The interhigh games are a blast!

Takehiko Inoue certainly knew how to end the series with a bang! The last game is so good, every character is at their best and certainly no other title can rile up the readers emotions like this, it really feels like your watching the NBA finals.

The artwork is simply great even though there are a lot of better looking manga out there, the decade old graphics still manages to go toe to toe with other more recent titles out there.

The characters of this title are by far the most fully developed in any title out in the market and I'm not just talking about the main characters, I'm also talking about the supporting cast even those belonging to rival teams. The character development is so good that it is difficult to choose one character as a favorite. Each character has a well told background even those who appear in just a few chapters have a very detailed and well executed background story. You'll probably remember the names of not only the Shohoku players but also the names of their rivals, most notably &amp;quot;Sendoh&amp;quot;.

Overall Slam Dunk is one of the best Manga ever made and I'm sure that once you read it, you will agree with me. I guarantee that you won't be able to resist finishing the manga in a few days if not a few hours because it is that damn good. If you think the anime was great, try reading the manga and I'm sure you'll feel that the anime series could have been better, the interhigh games are one hell of a joyride!",2009-02-05T08:09:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=12153
52,targetoverload,10,"Whistle! is a most read manga for all ages. Even if you find that you don't care for sports, or like Shounen Jump Manga, I honestly recommend that you give this one a try. I've reread Whistle! so many times now that I've lost track of the exact number. But I thought I would tell you a little bit about why I love this series so much. It's one of the most inspiring manga series I've ever read. And the only one I own most of. I have a hard time finding any fault in this series. I think the story is amazing. The artworkis fanominal. All the characters tend to grow on you. The enjoyment is intense and exciting. And overall this manga series is bewildering. After each volume... each chapter really... I couldn't wait for more. I still get those same feelings every time I pick up this series. 

I think the author did an excellent job on capturing what it means to chase after dreams, the stumbles one may go through to reach those dreams, and the people who may be on the sidelines silently showing their support, through love and care. But most of all, the author, through this series, shows that anything can be achieved through hard work and devotion. 

I love the spirit of Whistle! It has such great moods and a different atmosphere from other Shounen Jump Manga, that I've read. Because you get to see through the eyes of a character who really struggles, it feels more believable in a lot of ways. 

Sho Kazamatsuri, he doesn't believe that he's very good, and he isn't at first. But he works harder to make up for what he lacks skill-wise and technique-wise. His passion (obsession) makes it hard not to fall in love with him, as the main character. His drive could make it impossible to beat him. But most of all, his personality just draws the best out of those around him, it doesn't matter if they're his teammates or not. Through each volume Sho meets many amazing characters who continually influence him to do the best he can, and to be the best he can be. 

I could go through just about all of the characters this same way... telling you just why I love them... but I don't think I'm going to. I'm sure you could just read this series and find out for yourself why I love it so much.

So please just check it out. You might find that you enjoy it just as much as I do. 


""If your opponent is a superior player... you need to polish what your best at then use it in the fight."" -Ko Kazamatsuri

Thanks for reading. If this Review makes you, in even the smallest way, want to pick up a volume of Whistle! and start reading today... then I'm glad.

53,Rakuen42,8,"The opening volumes, where they try and put Yusuke’s personality on track, was what started to pull me in. He reminds me a lot of Onizuka, another character I loved, in that he’s so wonderfully flawed. You don’t see Goku having some sudden epiphany and becoming a better person because he’s already sitting in the Lawful Good alignment to start with; there’s not a whole lot of room there for progression. By contrast, the delinquent is a great character to make the protagonist because he can’t be perfect and he has to grow at some point. Starting the series off deadand in need of redemption really gives that development a kick in the pants too.  Of course, Yusuke never makes it marginally close to being paragon of justice.  He is generally good, has a sense of justice, and cares about his friends mind you, but ultimately he just wants a good brawl, and saving the world in the process is gravy.

This leads into the other characters.  Kuwabara is another delinquent who is determined to become more powerful that Yusuke some day.  Since he’s not the main character, you can guess how well this is going to work out.  He grows in a much different direction though, motivated by a few events in the story (one seemingly minor) and his blinding determination to never give up.  Kurama is a formerly powerful demon that has been stuck inside of a human’s body.  Forced to see life through humanity’s eyes, he reforms his ways and becomes a protector of the race.  Finally, Hiei is an enigma for the majority of the series, you don’t even find out much of his motivations until the final arc.  Even he develops a minor form of justice and a grudging respect for Yusuke.  Overall, I loved these characters and their interactions throughout the story.  Their personality clashes allow for a decent bit of levity to lighten up the fighting backdrop.

If you’re looking for a story, well, it’s a good thing there’s strong characters, because this is a Shonen series.  You should check your story at the door.  But, a plot still exists, and there are definite motivations to the characters’ actions.  A few of the villains can even be painted as a bit unfortunate in their path to evil (or are they really evil?). The ending theme and eventual moral to this whole story is the same as that which Nippon Ichi has taken and ran with for the past few years.  Light is not good and dark is not bad.  Judging people based on stereotypes and what you’ve always been taught to believe is never the way to go; each being deserves to be looked at based on their own merits and shortcomings.  Given that’s the conclusion, it’s natural that Yusuke ends up being a mostly neutral aligned character.  Beyond that, like every shonen, there’s going to be those ludicrous points (such as the entire final arc), but just sit back and let it pay off on sheer enjoyment factor, because it will.

Manga pretty well rests on the art style, and this series doesn’t disappoint.  I don’t know how many times I looked at a fight scene… then went back again… and again.  They’re drawn well, lots of action and explosions and all that greatness.  As a warning though, the further you get in the series, the more gore you’re going to see.  Backgrounds are well drawn when they’re the focal point of the panel, and take a natural backseat in quality and appearance when they’d end up detracting from the main attraction.   The same process applies to the character designs, and they’re generally in that decent to good range that you get in this genre.  I do have to say that I liked a lot of the enemy characters, for appearing for such a short time there’s some original design put into them.  In particular, I really liked Younger Toguro’s design.

Bottom line, this is a shonen series; you know roughly what to expect in this territory.  If you like the genre then I’m going to wonder why you haven’t read this yet.  If you’re not much of a fan, this series might not convert you, but it’ll still be a pretty good ride throughout.

Final Score: 8/10 SPIRIT SHOTGUNS!",2009-09-20T10:22:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=18956
54,mastertek,10,"I finally finished reading this masterpiece... All I must say is this manga is not just a must-read or must-rate, but a MUST-FAVORITE! You can't run into another masterpiece like this in many decades. This one surpasses all other manga series in my fav-list, even though its anime adaptions are not so great. Story: 8/10 -The only thing it lacks is ROMANCE. This was a pain at first for me but I quickly forgot that, being completely enthralled by the duels. Also, there are times when the motives behind the duels were not so reasonable and convincing. Nevertheless, the author did a great great job. -In thefirst volumes, our two Yugis and companions started off building friendship with their ex-enemies and admonishing guys beyond cure, by playing a lot of bizarre and EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE games. These games require both physical and brain power and often concluded CONVINCINGLY with Yugi's victories.

-Most and main parts of the manga comprise of only duels of Monster Card Game, which is mostly agreed to be the best and most intelligent MEDIUM to settle things. Even though there are MIRACLES happening from time to time to the protagonists' favor but, given the countless number of battles throughout 343 chapters, these DRAMATIZED events are completely OK! There's completely nothing to complain about the perfect flow and ending.

-In conclusion, the plot is very well planned and carried out CONSISTENTLY from beginning to end even with all the ad-lib/improvisation, weaving together characters' relations and even the cards in Yugi's deck.

Art: 9/10
-At first the tone was very hard and dark. The characters looked short and bold. But later on when the Card Duel Games got more and more serious and intense, the character design improved gradually. The determined look of Yugi II and the atrocious look of all antagonists are perfect. FEMALE characters are notably lovable most of the time! Besides, monster designs are perfect and consistent - the author successfully created a distinguishable universe for his monsters - just like in Pokemon - they are not just a bunch of random shits like in Berserk or D.Gray-man and other common lots.

Character: 8/10
-The character development/growth of protagonists - Yugi I, Yugi II, Kaiba, Jonuochi - can be observed easily. They became more and more mature, determined, and strong in many ways. However, all supporting characters are overshadowed right after their debuts.

Enjoyment: 9.5/10
-My enjoyment is absolute during the first volumes when Yugi played games other than the Duel Monster Card. Even though it waned a bit towards the end, no matter how many times I read this work, no matter how times I think about this manga, it always should stand out to be loved the most!

Overall: 10/10
-Despite all the tiny faults and misses, as I said, you canNOT read anything like this any time soon so you should OVERRATE it and encourage mangaka's to draw great things like this!",2010-07-18T00:09:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=28545
55,Master10K,9,"The story of a young man having a new familial responsibility, foisted upon him, is not a new concept. However Aishiteruze Baby (a Shoujo, Slice of Life, Romance, Drama) is one of the earlier ones that follow this (now) tried and true formula. Just like in several other shoujo manga, set in a high school; we have Kippei, a student who happens to be a bit of a playboy. Yet instead of being the usual love interest of our mediocre female protagonist, the story forgoes all of that and sticks him in the main driving seat. Sleeping through class and flirting with all the girls whoapproach him. This is until, due to some family matters, he is stuck looking after his 5 year old cousin Yuzuyu. From here the story takes shape, as each volume focuses on newly introduced side-characters and a different issue to do with a variety of themes like: obsession, separation, depression and seeking happiness. Providing the reader with a different feel for every volume, but this also means that you'll specifically enjoy reading certain volumes more than others. I am personally not fond of the 1st volume's story. 

However what make the whole experience worthwhile, are the characters Kippei &amp; Yuzuru and seeing how their forced relationship develops over time, into something truly genuine. With an irresponsible teen like Kippei discovering what it means to be responsible, as he takes on the parental role in looking after the adorable Yuzuru. Giving the reader a nice warm feeling, with plenty of cute and dramatic moments, of character development for the pair. And seeing how each volume focuses on a certain/set of side-character(s), they also get a fair amount of depth added to their character. Though not all of them seem good enough to become recurring characters.

But what seems ""good enough"" to the mangaka, is the artwork. As nothing about it screams ""gorgeous"" or ""meticulous"". Just ""good enough"". With its fine characters designs and a decent level of detail put into them, all tacked together in panels and speech bubbles arranged in a serviceable manner. Nothing special, just typical shoujo.

Overall Aishiteruze Baby proved to be a very enjoyable shoujo manga to read. As a guy into my typical shounen battle manga and seinen thrillers, I am glad that this is my first endeavour into shoujo manga. As I found this story to be very heart-warming, full of some fairly universal social issues and the everyday troubles of looking after a kid. The story never really felt dragged out and it flowed at a steady pace. There’s a decent amount of humour, romance and drama and none of these elements seemed overbearing, which can be somewhat of a double-edged sword, as some of the issues do seem rather trivial. Making it a very casual and heartfelt read.",2007-10-24T05:01:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=1104
57,Ione,9,"If you&rsquo;re looking for a High School drama filled with yearning romance, hilarious situations, quite pretty art and boys who are (or think they are) gay, then this is the manga for you! There are photo shoots, bullying, beaches, treasure hunts, sports, with a little bit of alcohol and cross-dressing on the side. Great fun! Story: For the story, I give it an 8. It was a good tale, if a little on the stale side with some of the plotlines. But only some! The overall &lsquo;Girl likes Guy in High School&rsquo; plot is mixed up a bit with the main character (Mizuki) pretending to bea boy, with just the right amount of Drama and Angst to keep a reader interested. And the best thing about the story? It&amp;rsquo;s complete!

Art: I must give it a 9! Beautiful artwork. The boys all look very pretty, but don&amp;rsquo;t expect much from the backgrounds. I mean, they're not bad, but they are not the main focus. The focus in this manga is mostly on the characters &amp;ndash; which are gorgeous I must say again. There are some SD parts when the characters are flipping out, but they don&amp;rsquo;t dominate the story, and the silliness of the artwork at those times adds to the humour. Very nice overall!

Character: Ahhh, the characters... Definitely a 10! I think the characters were the reason I was able to finish this manga so fast! I absolutely love dramatic interactions between the people in the stories I read, and this has it all! There are relationships that range from romantic to fanatic and back again. Great stuff.

Enjoyment: 9! I loved this manga so much, that when I found out that there was a real-life TV show of it in Japan, I watched as many episodes I could find online at the time... Oh dear me, I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that the shininess and the cheesiness didn&amp;rsquo;t kill me. But yes, I really enjoyed it. :D

Overall, I give this manga a 9. I thought it was a great manga, and well worth a casual read if you&amp;rsquo;re ever in the mood for a humour/romance shoujo manga.

67,TCHaos,8,"2001 Nights is a nice anthology of deep-space exploration stories delivered in a western style of comic art. The quality reminds you of the silver age of comics, but there is great detail in both expression and scenary. While the different stories have no apparent relation or continuation to each other, there is a steady progression in theme throughout the volumes. The first few start with more contemporary space flight achievements or deal with events that take place within our own solar system. The later stages involve more far-reaching destinations and are more fanciful in imagination. There is a great array of concepts and ideasto match the often bizarre new 'circumstances' the protagonists encounter. These are all backed by an often sizable amount of scientifically related information, but is done so to be both informative and also provide the backbone for the plot. While this might put-off some of the readers, it does enhance the reading and shows the near endless real-life scientific possibilities that could exist out in the universe. 

However, the greatest appeal is the ever present moral and philosophical questions that surround the topic of space exploration. Exploitation rights of resources, the pursuit of knowledge, extra-terrestrial life, destruction, conquest, wars and the urge to find ourselves within the emptiness of space gives enough for the reader to contemplate. While much of 2001 Nights has a sobering undertone to it, they all depict the future as a wonderess one which only we ourselves can decide on how to leave our marks on.

68,Abolishedfall,4,"I wanted to like this manga. I really did. The first 40 chapters or so were great, but at that halfway mark it started feeling like the author didn't plan it out. At the final arc of the story everything went down the drain, for some reason a supporting character attempts to rape the main character, and nobody cares. The love interest tells a wench MC-Kun was dating that MC-Kun was missing. Overall, the manga was supbar. The author was clearly a fan of the ""Damsel in distress"" cliché considering that 4 of the 6 arcs were based on it. There was also some problematicborderline transphobia, but considering the year it came out it's acceptable. It also felt kind of strange that the only black guy had the mental faculties of a child.

69,ishitagupta,7,"The one feature that pointedly stands out in this story is the kawaiiness of both the leads. Their hair... Ooh so fluffy that I wanted to reach out and run my fingers through them! This of course lends the characters a good degree of personal touch and you sympathise more with their predicament. Shiina and Kiri are siblings and Kiri while a player-prince in school loves his sister dearly always making her treats and soothing her and giving her rides to school. Only Shiina knows something about him that she shouldn't. That something incites more than brotherly love for Kiri in her and she feels weigheddown with guilt and shame for such feelings. However, seeing as the newly single Kiri is a commodity all Shiina's friends want a piece of, she's forced to make a decision, whether to reveal her feelings or step out of the way and let her friends confess. Sheesh, that IS a quandry!

I heart the brotherly sisterly relation these two share right at the beginning of the story. Who wouldn't want a brother to dote on them so and brighten their day?! Other than that, the artwork is really sparkly in that Kiri's smile can completely lighten your mood and you smile right back at that bishie! The story progresses at a very realistic pace without being overly shoujo about it and portrays both leads in a very human light in their reactions and inhibitions. Overall I liked every scene regardless of whether it included kisses or not which is rare and in this case fully deserved! If you're feeling low about how meaningless love and affection is, I recommend this tale.",2009-03-09T12:02:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=13053
70,sangwiny,7,"I binged this manga over the last few days after having it on my PTR list for way too long. Because of that, I can offer you a review that is not shrouded by nostalgia or anger at hiatuses. It was running a whopping 15 years after all. Art: 6 Nothing groundbreaking but pleasant to look at. Character designs are though out and make named characters easily distinguishable, though faces sometimes look weird and deformed. There was a little bit of inconsistency with some frames having obviously put tremendous effort into them while others being done more 'efficiently' (eg. no background, shading, etc). My biggest beefwith the art is battle scenes, not to be confused with fight scenes which were done very well. Battle scenes were a mess. Half the time you have no idea what is exploding, where a shot is coming from or going towards, or simply what are you even looking at. This makes for a fairly chaotic experience and will force you to pause at frames very often just to figure out what's going on.

Character: 6.5

I really liked the main character even though he's total Gary Stu. His motivations make sense and are consistent, his character changes ever so slightly with how he is influenced by the progress on his quest and new friends joining him. Supporting cast is mostly made up of standard archetypes, so I'm not gonna expand on them. Villains were kind of a mixed bad. Some of them were written amazingly, with great motivations and gray personality, while others (especially the minor and nameless ones) were just cartoonishly evil for the sake of being evil.

Story: 6.5

The story set up a very interesting premise and managed to keep its dark tones all the way until the end. The later part of the story felt a little bit rushed but was enjoyable regardless and managed to deliver a fairly satisfactory conclusion to itself at the end. The main problem I had with the story is how convenient everything was. There is always someone coming to rescue the main cast, or when they do lose there are very little consequences to it. The most convenient of all is how almost every character immediately accepted Köinzell's side of 'the truth'.

Enjoyment: 8

I'm a sucker for dark fantasies, so despite my previous complaints, I still enjoyed this series very much. Though the fluency of going through chapters was occasionally disrupted by messy battle scenes, it still allowed for a decent immersion and an enjoyable experience. There was a plethora of hype and badass moments, and I can't really remember getting bored at any part, even when exposition was being delivered.

Overall: 7

If you like the dark fantasy genre, then this is definitely worth your time. This series has both very original parts and very cliche parts, so your enjoyment will be standing on whether you like these tropes or not.  If you are a fan of hype fights, MC being a badass, and the dark side of people being portrayed without kiddy gloves on, then this is definitely the series for you.

71,ishitagupta,10,"I have been a Fushigi Yuugi otaku since the past 9 years now, so when I finally got around to checking out Watase's other works, Zettai obviously stood out for its more swoony description and the unbeatable bishi artwork. You'll be hard pressed to find a dreamier android boytoy than Night Tenjou! Or a more thoughtful one. Though that's not all Zettai boasts of... You obviously know that a girl unwittingly orders herself an android-like boyfriend online, but what arrives is nothing robotic or even human. Superhuman maybe! He's charming and makes her weak in the knees but obviously, just when a couple has found happiness,the boy next door (literally) has to suddenly confess his undying love for the heroine. Grr. Trials and tribulations ensue, though not all of them are of the hackneyed kind. Some situations like sticking together in a couple's spa despite running naked and protecting your boyfriend's chastity by climbing up a balcony are pretty darn novel! It's not something you stop crying for even after the fifth or sixth read and that's really saying something about a 6 volume manga!

Art wise, I see similarities in how Night and Tamahome and other Watase bishies are drawn, it's almost identical, but I guess dashing knights in shining armors always end up looking equally swoon-worthy! The few action sequences, combat or otherwise are done masterfully, with each character's motion and style being unique. Riico is drawn well enough but what really stands out in this manga is her and everyone else's chibi expressions! Really, the range of facials these SD characters are capable of puts us lowly humans to shame! Each page is littered with plenty of them, and you can especially look forward to Gaku being his eccentric self, chibi and otherwise with plenty of smart ass dialogues and odd angles to his eyebrows which induce the giggles only too easily.

Each character is thoroughly invested in, they aren't just cardboard cut outs of ideal boy, naive love starved ingénue, and infatuated boy next door. 
I adored how Night was portrayed as this naive but besotted lover figure that is hopelessly devoted to making Riiko happy and is still learning the ropes... Though maybe he goes a bit far sometimes like when he asks Soshi if he knows what Riico's sensitive spots are! However, his quixotic view of his undying feelings for Riico despite his physical limitations fully exonerates him of any slights he may have made along the way. Little things he does like remake a broken bracelet and offer his own services to help make money which he's not supposedly programmed to do, make him an endearing character. 
I'm not a huge Soshi fan, so I can't appreciate him as well, but the fellow had his moments. He was always coming to Riico's rescue when he could, and was forever on the lookout for semi-vulnerable moments where he'd entrance Riico with his personal understated charm. He was depicted realistically, as being shy and hiding his feelings at first with incessant teasing but only realizing their true depth when his position as No.1 Comforter was threatened.
Of course Riico is the lead in so many ways. Though she appears to simply be looking for a (read any living, breathing, capable of physical intimacy) boyfriend, she shows a lot of moral restraint throughout the story as well as moments of unprecedented maturity and personal sacrifice whenever Night's safety is in question. Sure she's clumsy and mediocre and prone to jealousy and insecurity, but really, which 16 year old isn't? She's just a character we're supposed to relate to, so it's expected of her to have tangible flaws.

Secondary characters lend the most flair to this manga, and Gaku tops that list hands down! His cheeky delivery of in-your-face dialogues along with outrageously lurid suggestions regarding Riico’s virginity makes him a most likeable candidate for comedic relief. Then there's Riico's new friend who brings her own back story into the plot. Clever little side characters like Riico and Soshi's boss at the restaurant assure you that the manga is not taking your sense of humor for granted and surely wants to titillate your palette right through the end.

Hmm, most importantly of course, being that it's shoujo, there are plenty and I mean PLENTY of those almost intimate moments that make your heart scream ba thump ba thump. There's enough fan service courtesy Night to keep you up at night cursing Riico's great fortune and drooling at his physique at the same time. And there are also some heart wrenching scenes with both Night and Soshi to make you lose your train of though for just an instant and simply stare into the character's (magnificently drawn) faces!

I think you should definitely give this a read. The plotline becomes less trite and predictable after the first three chapters, and you're sucked into this beautiful realm where the only ideal in a bishie's existence is to be the best boyfriend possible at all costs! Personally I feel the ending is a little abrupt and unfinished somehow, but not something that makes you regret reading Zettai. If Watase were to come out with a sequel or related work even after some years, I know I would be an instant fan.

While shorter than Fushigi Yuugi, Zettai Kareshi invokes the same passionate responses in readers that FY possibly did. You fall in love with characters and their weaknesses and strengths, you cheer for a couple to stay together and feel oddly anxious when they face obstacles (So much so that you want to jump into the panel and rip apart the occasional villains and just force Night on Riico!). I think Yuu Watase is very skilled at making you really become a part of her fascinating world like this. You want to vicariously live Riico's life here and once you start the manga, I'm pretty sure you won't have the control to put it down without devouring it whole!",2009-03-10T13:45:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=13088
72,AMVP,8,"I was plesantly surprised by this manga (I'm not calling it a series, since it's only two volumes long). The humor is a bit absurd but translates well alll the same, and it's plot doesn't get to bogged down (except just before the ending for a bit). Truth be told, there's nothing that exceptional about it: characters are colorful (a few are annoyingly so) but fairly normal, and the premise is pretty common actually. Still, it manages to pull everything off with good results, and the ending, while a tad sudden, is satisfying. The manga actually seems to benefit from being so short. Had itbeen longer, I imagine things getting diluted and derivative. Rather, being only two volumes long, there's a franticly crowded atmosphere which lends itself to quick reading and rereading. Not the deepest of manga (unless you like fanservice, both trivial and ecchi), it accomplishes what it strives successfully, certainly more so than many of its peers.",2008-05-28T07:41:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5064
73,rondoblend,5,"You often read it in the newspaper a teenage girl with psychically abusive boyfriend, the boy first seemed to be a nice and caring guy as time flows he begin to reveal to show his true natures and start hitting his own girlfriend. As common sense dictates, the girl tries to keep her distance and tries to escape from his clutch. Unfortunately for her the boyfriend is the most popular jock in school , an American football quarterback. So with thehelp of  his loyal friends he endeavors to make her life feels  like hell. Any who  sides with  her or shows sympathy will be targeted.    Fortunately,  the girl  could  seek  her parents. and finally  able to flee  by  transferring to another school.  

I read the story in People  magazine and it's a true story.  The girl was lucky  a few  months ago  i heard  news  about the  murder of a first year university student in her  dormitory room.  It turned out  that   the murder was  masterminded  by her ex high school  boyfriend  who had  been terrorizing  her ever since she broke up with him. It's sad, she finally thought  she was safe and could begin  her new life and started dating a new guy. but then her life  was abruptly  stopped by  a boy  who thought  that he loved her more than  any living person in the world.

Ito  Ogure must have a bitter past experience with females  like   being rejected many times, or they often made fun of him and shunned him. Because the manga only victimize females  violence and brutality  in this manga are directed toward them, read the manga and you know what i mean. especially girls who are beautiful, charming  and charismatic. The girls who are beyond the reach  of otaku like Ogure.  Maya might be  the representation of  the must  popular girl in ito Ogure's high school , and this is his way to take revenge on her.

Back to the manga

The essence of the manga is the story of  a teenager   who joined a gang because her brother was a member , eventually she realized  that  the gang was involved in  bad things,  she wanted  to quit  but the gang refused to let her go.  The members of the gang then  started to prosecute her.

 She was an orphan  and her little sister  was too young and stupid to be asked  for help ( the little sister also watched too many love dramas).  It’s also combined with  the story of the most popular students  at school (an artifact of teen movies in 90’s)  but   the mangaka took it to a higher level  and gave it a twist.

review 

-Violence against women.
You think  that   because   Maya and  Aya are   the heroes they will be cool and awesome right? Wrong  Aya is a ditz and Maya is neither bright  and  stupid.   Ogure  made  her an awesome   warrior  but  a lousy  leader.  Maya, many   tragedies  in this  Manga are caused by her  inability  to rein  in her  troops and developed  their  potency   and  use them.   Many  members  of Jyuken are supposed to be  very strong  fighters,  but Maya is often oblivious to  this fact  and acts individually  with predictable  result , she  always badly wounds  herself.      somebody  should say  “ Stop Maya before she hurts herself “.

Maya  is the main subject  to Ito Ogure’s wrath against women , he always  torture  her  and constantly beat her    Through  the  hands  of her abusive  ex boyfriend and his gang    or an unknown  enemy. Why  I think Ogure  harbors vengeance and hatred  againts women?  Because  98%  of lead and supporting  male characters  are  invincible  and can’t get hurt . But  this  manga is infamous for its violence  and mutilation  and the heroes are always  in danger, yes  it’s partially  correct,  because the subjects of the violence  are  the women they are the ones who  are always in danger.   Except  for   Aya,  Ogure might have thought  that  she was too stupid.


-  The characters   have  no clear motivation
.   If Ogure did provide  a motivation  for a character’s action  it will always be  love, it’s  seems that love is the only language  that Ogure know  he might have tried really hard to come up with a   new idea   but he eventually gave up.    sometimes  Ogure would not even bother  to give explanation  why  one does specific  action, Even when one knew that one’s  action will  maim oneself.  

-Incoherent story
Psychologists often  warn  that  Japanese manga  are not good for children because   villains  quickly  change side and become friends to our heroes . But  this is worse Ogure came up  with a plot but didn’t know  how to execute it .
I want to give an example, but because spoiler is not allowed, I’ll use an analogy ,  there  is  a fish on table,   A , B and C are ordered to   keep eyes  on the fish,  A left  to take  a walk, when B and C let their guard  down  a cat snatches the fish. 

 Moments  later  D, E and F come.  Seeing that the fish is gone    D openly accuses that  A ate  the fish and is now  taking a walk.B   clearly saw A   had left  the house earlier therefore  could  reason that A there is no way A could have eaten the fish, but instead of defending A, B  burst  into tears and   hopes that  A will be back soon .  

E  is the leader, but   doesn’t bother  to question  whether  A really did eat the fish and to look for proof.  So instead  of  investigating  this matter  thoroughly or  look for A,  those five reach a consensus that A  ate the fish.      

+ great artwork
At the beginning the artwork really  suck  but  it gradually keep  getting betting,  and  become the greatest  artwork that i have ever seen   

+characters are easy  to relate to
Who doesn’t  want to relate him/herself  to   a beautiful  and  handsome characters.  The female are gorgeous and the  male are very muscular and cool. It doesn’t  matter that the characters  are stupid  and shallow ,  nobody would give a damn. And you want to keep reading Tenjou Tenge because   “ I want to know what  will happen to this chick, plus i want to see her naked”.

+ Definetely not a cliche
The story has its own  strength,  unlike  other manga  the  story is not a cliche.  Instead telling  the story about  a Noveu venu ( Newcomer),  Ogure  preserved the status quo . There is a ton of surprises waiting around the corner.
Oh yeah, considering how bad  the story is, you will also  learn to appreciate the work of other mangaka.

Judgement
One thing  that   Oh Great ( Ogure) really  great is the  artwork,  The quality  is unrivaled  there  will be always  guys out there,   who is willing to pay  a few bucks  to gaze upon chicks no matter how bad the story is.  . A distinguished author in my country once said Quality  is not a problem, as long as  it  is readable , it will sell well.   reading  this manga is like an addiction, you know it's bad for you  but  you refuse  to stop because "" people want to care for  the beautiful girl/handsome hunk  and want to be associated with him/her and want to be around  him/her. .But please Ogure, don’t abuse it, cause people can eventually get sick of it  and throw it away, or they decide not to read in the first place.

Why i am so worked up over a manga?Because The Manga romanticized  abusive relationship between man and woman, but as i mentioned before, in the real life it can be really terryifying.A research revealed that women who read fairy tale like Cinderella in their childhood  often kept hanging  onto an abusive relationship because they believed  their  partner would eventually for the better, in most of the cases the men didn't change. What do ypu think will happen if a girl read tenjou tenge?  


Ogure should  read    more books especially novels and psychology textbook to  learn about  causality effect  and motivation.",2011-11-30T02:30:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=48341
74,Master10K,8,"Oh great ... yet another bombastic manga, developing from its humble beginnings, into the convoluted mess I see before me. Anyone who has read most of it, or its previous incarnation Tenjou Tenge, will understand what I mean. Air Gear is an exciting Shounen, Sports, Ecchi, Comedy that takes extreme sports to a whole new level. Nevertheless this is an Oh! Great manga; so expect mind-numbing violence, x-rated fanservice and an absurdly over-the-top storyline. As it follows Itsuki Minami (Ikki), a boy who comes across as your typical teenage delinquent, with no real purpose or goal in life; but that soon changes when he discovers thewonders of the popular extreme sport known as “Air Treck”. Now Air Treck is like if you took rollerblading and stuck it in a shounen manga like Hunter x Hunter. I know that not everyone will understand the analogy, but it is the only way one can even describe the latter 2/3rds of the manga. 

Now the way that most shounen sports manga go, is by first introducing the protagonist to the sport and have said protagonist be met with an obstacle they must overcome through both training and sheer force of will, then come across an even greater obstacle. Rinse and repeat. Sure Air Gear follows this formula but there’s a number well-conceived concepts that give this manga an edge over others; like the formation of an AT team, the bonds between them and infinite possibilities of ATs. From then on the story continually develops by adding new elements (e.g. Regalia) to the plot. Unfortunately the deeper the story goes, the more it loses the original essence that once captivated the reader and in turn becomes such a convoluted mess that even I struggled to follow. Which isn't helped by the poorly written dialogue the characters spew, when explaining a trick/skill/ability that often consists of either: something random scientifically proven theory, some random ancient mythology or some random philosophy. 

But one thing that never loses its essence in Air Gear, is the cluster of clichéd but cool characters that fulfil every single archetype imaginable. Yet I feel somewhat torn when it comes to evaluating the characters of Air Gear. Because on the one hand you have Ikki, the main protagonist, who we will follow as he struggles to get to the top and pretty much exudes ""cool"" whilst doing so. But it's not only him, as it is often nice to see his comrades develop along the way too, meaning that no one is left on the wayside. I in particular enjoyed seeing Kazu struggle to break free from Ikki's shadow and become truly formidable in his own right. Even side characters who seem unimportant at first are given enough time in the spotlight, for the readers to learn what motivates them all. Then on the other hand you have a certain character, who shall not be named, that drastically undergoes the most contrived transformation imaginable and then there's Barack Obama... nuff said. Which is why I feel torn, because there's an amazing cast of characters and then a few that kind of ruin it. 

Yet I can be decisive in saying the artwork is the best thing about Air Gear, with its unique look and well thought-out design that sets it apart from all other shounen manga (except other Oh! Great manga). Not only are the characters fun to look at, with their distinct looks and their expressively drawn attitudes, but this is the first time I'll praise the SFX katakana for not only being noticeable but for enhancing those intense moments. The environments are also very detailed and it’s easy to see that a lot of time, effort and creativity has gone into illustrating every battle.

Overall Air Gear is exactly what you’d expect from an Oh! Great manga: really crude perverse humour, imaginative character designs, extreme levels of fanservice and an over-the-top story to tie it all together. Now usually serialized shounen manga will prolong their run by continually upping the stacks, whilst retaining the theme that originally sucked in the readers. However where Air Gear falters is that mangaka continually adds new elements to the plot, transforming it from a sports battle manga hybrid into a pure shounen battle manga, disregarding what originally sucked the reader in. Gravity Children, Brain Charger, Barack Obama... Just to name a few of the random things later added to the plot that give off the feeling that not much thought was put into how they'd affect the story as a whole. 

In the end what is left is a story riddled with huge gaping plot holes, as far as the eye can see and no way to close them without completely abandoning your own sense of disbelief. But it doesn’t change the fact that this is still a hugely entertaining shounen manga to read, if you enjoy shounen manga. Just keep in mind that you may have to turn off your brain from time to time, which is a damn shame.",2008-06-29T16:17:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5900
75,Archaeon,8,"Every so often an anime or manga comes along that forces you to rethink your perspective on a particular genre. Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou changed how I viewed sci-fi. Barefoot Gen redefined my idea of tragedies. Sanctuary altered my preconcieved notions of thrillers. And Ai Yori Aoshi changed how I viewed romantic manga. Ai Yori Aoshi (or Bluer than Indigo), was created by Fumizuki Kou, and was originally serialized in Young Animal magazine from 1998 to 2005, when the series ended. The title was inspired by a quote from the Chinese philosopher Xun Zi which states that &quot;Blue comes from indigo, but is bluer than indigo&quot;, andis used in both China and Japan as a reference to surpassing one's teacher through one's own efforts.

The manga series proved to be extremely popular amongst older Japanese teens and men aged 20-30. Because of it's popularity, the series was adapted as an anime in 2002, with a sequel, Ai Yori Aoshi ~Enishi~, released in 2003. Both series were directed by Shimoda Masami (Saber Marionette J, Someday's Dreamers, E's Otherwise). A game was also released based on the series for the Playstation 2 and the PC.

Now, it's no secret that I'm not a big fan of harem rom-com/dramas, especially the ecchi type. Some are reasonable enough (i.e. no permanent brain damage from reading/watching them), whilst others are so bad that the creators should be shot. Thankfully Ai Yori Aoshi falls into neither of those categories. 

The story is extremely simple in many ways. Ai Yori Aoshi is a harem rom-com/drama after all. However the approach to the story is where the big difference lies. In Ai Yori Aoshi, the two main protagonists are betrothed right from the start of the series, something which is unusual for harem based manga and anime. 

The first chapter begins with Sakuraba Aoi trying to make her way through a train station. She has left the safety of her home to search for the boy to whom she was betrothed as a child. Unfortunately her sheltered upbringing causes her to get lost easily, and she is unfamiliar with train stations in general. She is knocked over by someone in a hurry, and is helped to her feet a young man, who takes the time to fix her sandal, and who guides her to the address she is looking for. It may be fate or destiny, but the young man turns out to be Hanabishi Kaoru, the boy she was searching for, the one whom she hasn't seen for 18 years, and the man to whom she wants to devote her life.

This beginning is a big deviation from the stereotypical harem series, having a far more serious beginning than the standard fare that is available. There are other deviations as well, which all serve to separate Ai Yori Aoshi from the generic series that are so often spawned, and make it something a little more special )I'll cover some of these in a bit).

The artwork for Ai Yori Aoshi is very &amp;quot;straightforward&amp;quot;, compared to many series, however this simplicity is a reflection of the story. The open, expressive character designs make a nice change, especially when conferring deep emotions. The scenery is often quite detailed, and makes a nice contrast to the simplicity of the characters. The character designs are also well chosen, especially as this is a harem series. There are some cliche characters, however they're not annoying in the slightest.

Ai Yori Aoshi may be good or very good in it's story and art, but where it really shines is in it's characters. Rarely have I seen so much depth and background, or such strong leads in a manga, especially a harem rom-com/drama.

Sakuraba Aoi, the only daughter of the owner of the famous Sakuraba Department Store. She is the epitome of the Yamato Nadeshiko (a traditional Japanese beauty), and has lived her life with one clear goal in mind - to be a worthy wife to Hanabishi Kaoru. To that end she spent 18 years training daily in all the traditional Japanese arts (flower arranging, playing the koto, performing the tea ceremony, even as far as wearing a tsumugi kimono every day). Unlike many female harem leads, she is completely devoted to Kaoru, and unlike other female leads she is able to control her emotions well. 

I'm not going to go into detail about the other characters (bar one), except to say that, for the most part, almost all of the side characters have a depth of character that is rare in a harem series. Fumizuki Kou has gone to great lengths to give most of the side character a sense of realism that is so often missing in a romantic series. There are even segments of the story and special chapters devoted entirely to one (or more) of the side characters. One thing that really is different from the normal harem fare is the relationship between Aoi and Kaoru, as well as the relationships they have with the other characters (in particular Tina Foster, Kagurazaki Miyabi, Miyuki Mayu, Minazuki Taeko, and Minazuki Chika), and most importantly the relationships the side characters have with each other. This is where the side characters gain their sense of realism, and is a great thing to see in a manga.

And now for that one character I mentioned, and possibly the biggest deviation from the typical harem fare - Hanabishi Kaoru. He is, without doubt, one of the best romantic leads in manga to date. 

Hanabishi Kaoru is a character with an insane amount of depth and, unlike so many other harem leads, he is not a loser who deserves to be strangled at birth. He is a kind, intelligent, and very caring young man who tries his hardest to make his way in the world. When he first met Aoi as a child he was the heir to the Hanabishi business empire, however he turned his back on the Hanabishi household, which is the event that prompted Aoi to search for him. Kaoru initially doesn't remember Aoi or their betrothal, however unlike most other harem shows that feature a childhood promise, Kaoru actually has a reason that is not only plausible, but also very possible, for forgetting. Kaoru is very much a lead who is trying to come to terms with his past whilst attempting to make a future, and a nice change from the typical harem &amp;quot;who will he choose&amp;quot; fare is the fact that he is devoted to Aoi as well. Yes there are temptations along the way, but he works hard to overcome them.

Anyway, I ramble so I'll wind this down.

I will freely admit that I love this series. It's use of traditional Japanese culture gives the series a depth that is rare to see in a harem based romantic comedy/drama. The continued references, both visually and written, to traditional Japanese culture add a certain realistic feel to the whole series, and also serves to heighten some of the dramatic moments of the manga.

Granted, the manga does sometimes play fast and loose with the story, and some may view a number of chapters as nothing more than &amp;quot;filler&amp;quot; (which it isn't really but I'm not going to try and convince you of that). Fumizuki Kou does incorporate a number of typical ecchi harem situations into the series, however they didn't really bother me all that much because I was more interested in progressing with what proves to be a captivating love story.

I would readily recommend this to any fan of romantic or harem manga as it is an example of how good the harem genre could be if they only ditched the stereotypical loser male lead. I've noticed many comparisons between Ai Yori Aoshi and Love Hina, and I will say freely that they are as different as chalk and cheese, especially as Keitaro from Love Hina is a total loser who should be dropped off a cliff, and Kaoru is actually quite a kind, mature young man who cares about those around him more than he does himself.

This is an extremely rewarding read, and is definitely one of the sweetest love stories available in manga.",2009-01-19T16:31:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=11698
76,lady_ribbon,10,"Every now and then there will come a series that touches the deepest spaces of your heart, and remains with you for the rest of your life. This is one of them. Aka-chan to Boku, or Baby and Me as it is known to English audiences, is a manga that features an 11 year old boy who just recently lost his mother, and who must now step up and help take care of his baby brother while his father runs a busy job, and tries to keep things moving along. This is a very realistic and detailed slice-of-life manga showing the lifestyle of an elementary school childand his baby brother coping with the loss of their mother, though many other characters and their lives are given insight as well.

It is a real pity that this manga is not more well known outside of Japan, as it is one of the all time best selling Shoujo mangas there, and is truly a wonderful series.

It is also interesting to note that though this manga is classified as Shoujo, the layout of the series (the art panels) is much more like a Shonen, and the series on a whole feels more like a slice-of-life Shonen, or even a Josei series.

So, what makes this series so excellent?

★ Story (10) - It is strange to think that when you are a child, all you wish to do is to grow up and be an adult. When we are adults, we want nothing more than to be a child once more. This manga encompasses that nostalgic and yearned for childhood that some of us had, and others did not. It takes us away from the world of adults - but sneaks a peek in every now and then with the eyes of a child, or through the eyes of the grownups we all eventually become someday. 

This manga follows the day to day life and adventures (or misadventures) of the main family, and many other characters. Everything from a sick day to a hectic day at work; baseball games and school trips; bullying and unsure new mothers; holidays and even a kidnapping among many other things are all shown realistically while being comedic, sad, and often times nostalgic. This manga has a way with weaving words that speak volumes to the reader in their honesty and the truth of their feelings.

Several times surprisingly, rather tough or tricky topics are brought to light. For instance, there were chapters on family problems and a wayward son; unplanned pregnancies, masturbation and even the death of character. No, this manga does not shy away from more sensitive topics, but discusses them and treats them very realistically and in a fair way while not over dramatizing them.

The one problem I had with the story, was the timeline. The author says that the story takes place in just one year. However that cannot be correct, as for instance, Christmas and New Years are shown and celebrated more than once and seasons change many times among other things. However, this little blunder does not take away from the story, and does not ruin anything.

★ Art (10) - It is rare that a manga can convey such complex emotions and feelings through black and white artwork. It is rare, but in this case it was done, and done beautifully. The character does not even have to say anything whatsoever; but what they mean is shown through the expression in their face, a look in their eyes. The art style is very cute, very cleanly done, and very appealing to look at. The 90's style resonates through and though and adds a touch of nostalgia which, considering the story line, is utterly perfect for the tale. 

★ Character (10) - If there ever was a series with a cast of gold, this would be it. There are many characters in this manga, and while the main character's family gets the most attention, many other characters are very well fleshed out and the reader gets a very interesting peek into their lives ranging anywhere from a toddler, to a recently married couple with their first child, to the eccentric manager of a daycare. The characters all have distinct personalities, and all continue to develop and grow even when the focus is not on them. Even side characters who do not have much screen time are given sparkling personalities that shine through and make even the most mediocre of subjects interesting and vivid. The feelings of the characters in general are observed and followed very closely and penned down accurately. Truly, this author has the gift of making very three dimensional characters come alive on the pages of a book.

★ Enjoyment (10) - For all those who want a truly great manga to read and fall in love with, this is for you. For all those sick to death of cliche Shoujo mangas full of love and nonsense, this is what you need to pick up and read as soon as possible. There's no fantastic world, no epic quest or incredible romance featured in these pages. What there is a very human, very real story that makes its own magic in an everyday world, and makes its way through the struggles and triumphs of life through wonderful, realistic characters who, without trying, make you love them. There is nothing not to enjoy is this classic, and there is something for everyone in its covers.

★ Overall (10) - Growing up happens in a heartbeat. We toddle about on our hands and feet one day; the next, we walk confidentially towards the future and we're gone. No matter how far we journey though, our hearts still bask in the good and bad memories of our childhood. All the smiles and laughter of our youth; all the bumps and bruises as we climb the ladder to the adult word. We remember the streets and faces of our past though the names may escape us. We recall places and homes we have not been to, nor stepped in for many years. We recognize that behind each little house there are people; people with lives and stories and feelings all their own, bound together in the pain and love of life. And no matter how big we get, or how far away we go - we find ourselves looking back always; with yearning eyes and wanting heart.

This beautiful little gem of a story encompasses all those feelings and is utterly worth a read time and time again. And for 18 volumes we are given that absolute privilege of taking a walk back to the past as we once more step into the too-soon left behind but never forgotten world of childhood.",2013-04-28T21:19:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=95303
77,Narabinaki,9,"I enjoyed reading Alice 19th very much. The only genre I could think of giving this is Drama, so if you love a good romance then this is the manga for you! ~Story~ I thought the story was pretty good. It certainly wasn't the most amazing manga I've ever read, but it was quite good. This manga obviously has a strong moral about words, and how you should use them for kindness and not rudeness. It follows a girl, whose sister has fallen to the emotional &quot;darkness&quot; of her soul, and needs to be rescued, and the story progresses from there. Also, relationships develop and become quiteapparent. 
I think the reason I liked this so much was because it didn't drag on and on about how they love each other and how they need to get together like some manga does. The storyline was always progressing and that kept me entertained, not bored out of my mind.

~Art~

The art was pretty good; it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing, either. Yu Watase did a nice job portraying the characters and what their current emotion was. Also, when you see a shot of the entire city, it's very pretty and I think the author did a wonderful job. However, if you're looking for manga just based on the art, you might not want to choose Alice 19th, depending on your taste.

~Characters~

I loved the characters for this manga! There was obvious progression of the characters' love interests and traits. I think the author chose perfect characters for this story, as all the characters fit nicely with the storyline. There is Alice, the  younger sister who starts out wary of her actions and shy; Mayura, the older sister who is very pretty and gets what she wants when she wants it; Kyo, the handsome male protagonist who helps Alice throughout the story; Nyozeka, the bunny Lotis master that accompanies Alice and Kyo on their mission; Frey, who is a flirty Lotis master that came from Norway to help Alice and Kyo. There are also a few other characters that accompany them towards the end of the story.

~

Overall, I gave this manga a 9 because I thought Yu Watase did a nice job with the story and the romance between the characters. It was an enjoyable manga and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new, shoujo-ish romance manga to read.",2007-12-28T16:30:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=1732
78,straykatinacity,7,"Alichino COULD have been amazing… but unfortunately it was never truly finished. It does say on MAL that it ended at 3 books, but it wasn't SUPPOSE to. There was still much more to the plot left on said. According to a website, the mangaka broke his drawing arm and the series was put on haitus… but maybe they just gave up on it. However, it had great promise I thought. The artwork is absolutely stunning. If I got this series, though unfinished, it would be for the gorgeous character designs. Each one looks much different then the other, the mangaka paid great attention to detail.The eyes are so beautiful you just get sucked into them. The hair was styled oddly but it didn't change the beauty of each character.

Also the story was really intriguing. The creatures called 'Alichino' were of great fascination. The relationships between the 'Alichino' and humans was also really cool. I thought the whole plot was going well. The characters also each had an interesting backstory and mysteries of their own.

All together, though the series is unfinished, I'd take a look just for the gorgeous artwork. But then again, it might just leave you wanting more...",2011-01-29T13:41:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=34116
79,Jasonbear,10,"An extremely fantastic manga, if I may say so myself. I absolutely adore this manga and i'm honestly shocked that there are not many other reviews for this. I found this manga to be brilliant, not to mention thoroughly entertaining. The story is basically about a girl who is brought back in time to the ancient Egyptian time by an evil queen. Sounds pretty bland and cheesy, but surprisingly it was rather fresh. Red River is a wonderful combination of genres wrapped all in one single manga and presented in a way that will, without a doubt, keep you entertained. Action, romance (definitely!), drama, evil sadisticness- this manga dipped into a lot of genres. This manga did a wonderful job pulling readers into their plots. Reading Red River, at times, made me develop a passionate desire to punch some characters, kiss them, hug them, cry for them, pull their hair, cheer for them, throw my oversized textbooks at them (and let me tell you, they’re big and heavy enough to knock a bear out), and many more. 

The art of Red River was pretty old school, but still was very charming and definitely not so old school that it may repulse people who can get easily distracted by awful art (haha, i'm one). Actually, to the contrary, I thought the art was really good looking most of the times. In the beginning of the manga, where the background was still in modern day Japan, I probably would've found the art to be just satisfactory. But when the background of the story changed to Ancient Egypt, the art did a 180 and turned absolutely gorgeous. The ancient Egyptian clothes were everything that I wished it to be and more. The artist was wonderful in drawing the clothing since it was clear in the manga that the artist knew how to draw peasant clothes, flashy clothes, plain clothes, beautiful clothes, all those types, with the same charming style. Not to mention, all the characters were drawn rather well and, at many times, there were characters that were so good looking, I swooned a bit. 

The characters. My goodness, I cannot even describe how much I enjoyed the characters of this manga. They were all wonderfully unique and realistic in their own way, with the addition of each having their own charm. Character development was clear in this manga and it was done extremely well, in my opinion. The main protagonist of this manga developed from a feeble young girl to somebody who could be reckoned with and I loved it! At the dark and dramatic times of this manga, it was quite surprising who was revealed to be the evil character. I mean, there were quite a number of times new evil characters popped up, and I must admit I was suspicious of everybody and to my delight and surprise, characters I didn’t expect to be evil were evil and the characters I did were not (with the exception of the main antagonists)! The main male character I found to be incredible sweet. Such a love sick puppy I found him to be, yet still strong and upholding as any character I’ve met (read about) thus making such a wonderful character to favor. Honestly, I really can’t describe how much I enjoyed this manga’s characters so I apologize that this section probably just consists of relatively useless blabber. 

Maybe I’m at a lost for words, or maybe I’m just having a writer’s block, so please do your best to not judge this manga on the fact that my review is both choppy and probably not that great. But despite what my lack of writing skill may present to you, I really, honestly and purely, definitely recommend this manga; if not for the wonderful and relatively unique plot, or the gorgeous art, or the fantabulous characters, then for the pure and simple fact that this manga is such a sweet romance story, it can give you both an achy tooth and swell your heart up full of love.",2008-11-29T19:41:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=9940
80,rachelcabbit,6,"Angelic Layer This manga is Clamp's attempt at a battle manga. It is set in the same universe as Chobits, and contains similar themes, such as the relationships between created beings/robots/toys and humans. I read this after seeing an episode or two or the anime. It is a short enough series, atonly 5 volumes, so I finished it before I continued with the anime. 

Story

The story of Angelic Layer is simple, with limited twists and turns. Clamp attempted to have some shock twists but they are basic  and can be guessed a mile off. The manga is probably too short. I was expecting a few tournaments, some decent rivals and a love triangle, but none of these seemed to develop, though they would have all been possible in a longer series. The pacing was good, until the end when it all seemed rushed. The development of Misaki's skills is not shown, so it difficult to connect to Misaki as a character because there is not enough detail in the story to give her development. Things are left unexplained and relationships are created with little real reason other than to tie up the series. The concept of battle dolls is interesting though, and sets Clamp up nicely for their more famous series, Chobits. 


Art

I gave the art a 5/10. The art style is not as detailed as some of Clamp's other works. It is very similar to Cardcaptor Sakura and yet in Cardcaptor Sakura there are some beautifully designed cards, and a lot of detail is put into them, however the Angel Dolls in this series, though pretty, do not seem to be as detailed. 
The battle sequences in some scenes look quite rushed, yet there are some well drawn moves in other scenes. 
One thing that particularly struck me was the artwork in the karate moves Koutarou-chan performs for Misaki. A lot of work must have gone into those pages. 

Character

Clamp's heroine, Misaki Suzuhara, is a Sakura-esque girl who is sweet, cute, good at cooking and a little bit ditzy and naive, therefore she is a classic shoujo manga heroine, which is unusual as this manga was run in a shounen magazine. She learns little throughout the series other than the typical self-belief and friendship is important lessons most shoujo manga offer, and is essentially the same girl at the end of the series as in the beginning. 
She is surrounded by a cast of interesting people, including the mysterious Ichiro ""Icchan"" Mihara, a seemingly crazy scientist who encourages her into the world of Angelic Layer (and who has a role in the Chobits manga by Clamp), her new school friends Tamayo Hizaki and Koutarou Kobayashi, and Koutarou's younger sister, Hatoko. Tamayo is a typical energetic, sporty character who encourages the blossoming romance between nice-guy Koutarou and Misaki. Hatoko is a 5 year old Angelic Layer prodigy and a valuable source of information and support for Misaki. 
Would-be rivals are won over by Misaki's thoughfulness and sweetnature, and her self-belief. Icchan's younger brother Ohjiro Misaki looked as though eh would play a big role in the series on his first appearance however, he does not get much of a chance to grow. Misaki's mother's reason for leaving her daughter all those years is quite unbelievable (though funny) but overall the characters seem to be lacking development which could have happened if there were more volumes released. 

Enjoyment

Despite its shortcomings, Angelic Layer is a very sweet, enjoyable series to read. Though there are no major twists, it's pacing means you can keep reading without being bored, and there is a nice mix of action, romance and comedy. Icchan's entrances are amusing, and as are the brother-sister relationships between Koutarou and Tamayo, and Hatoko. 

Overall

I decided that 6 is a fair-enough rating for this series. It could have been so much more if it were even just 2 volumes longer, but it is a good read. The art is not too bad, just not of the usual Clamp high standards, and though the characters are your shoujo-manga staples, they are still fun to read. 
Angelic Layer is a good manga to read if you have nothing better to do, if you fancy a shortish series with lots of cute-action and if you are interested in what came a few years before Chobits. 

Note

The Angelic Layer anime made many changes from the manga, so if you have seen the anime first, expect there to be differences. The main ones are relationships and character motivation.",2009-10-01T02:05:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=19273
81,NowItsAngeTime,10,"For the purpose of this review, I’m going to write a review for both people who have watched the Aria anime already, and who have not and are only reading the manga. ---- Review for those HAVE NOT watched the anime: Aria is a very nice and relaxing slice of life manga that definitely deserves reading. One interesting thing about Aria is that it can be a bit hard to recommend to other people. Basically you follow the 3 main characters: Akari Mizunashi, Aika Granzchesta, and Alice Caroll as they work hard to become great undines… which are basically tour gondola rowers. While that might seem a bit odd,in the world they’re in, it actually fits pretty well!

Like most slice-of-lifes, besides the goal of becoming better undine, there is no big concrete “plot” to follow. Basically every chapter is a new adventure through the relaxing yet mysterious world of Neo-Venezia. A majority of the chapters consist of the main characters interacting with each other, or doing random things that people in regular life do today like visiting a coffee shop. However, there are also a bunch of “supernatural” events that happen throughout the story, and they usually involve Akari and… cats. But they’re still entertaining and they fits well with the fact that Aria is already a whole new world to the viewer.

Even if in most of the chapters there is “nothing that happens”, make no mistake, the characters themselves still get a good amount of development throughout the series, and it’s very nice slow and smooth just like the series.

Speaking of the characters, I would have to say every single one of the characters is very likable, including the minor characters. However, the 3 main characters and their mentors are easily the best characters in the show, and their likable personalities will definitely keep you interested throughout the story.


Overall, Aria is a very likable manga series with some nice stories, great characters, good character development, and it just knows how to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I definitely recommend reading it!


(This is my first review. If you can, If you put whether you thought this review was helpful or not can I have some constructive criticism of why you think so? Thanks!)

Review for those HAVE watched the anime:

Basically the majority of the actual content is about the same. There are a whole lot of differences though. A lot of the content featured in Aria the Animation is actually covered in the manga “Aqua”. The character “Ai” was actually a filler character in the anime, and does not appear in chapters where she would normally appear in the anime… except for the last chapter, since the author decided to put her in.

The actual order of the chapters is actually quite a bit different compared to the order the episodes aired in each season. Not only that, but you may get a few chapters that you saw in Aria the Natural then all of a sudden you may get a chapter that was from Aria the Origination or Animation or vice-versa. 

As you go through the manga you’ll notice that there are a whole bunch of episodes missing.. that’s because each season had about 3-5 episodes of filler each. 

Also, there are roughly 5-8 chapters that were not covered in the original anime. I’m actually a bit surprised that they left these out since all of them were great, but I suppose it may have been a bit hard to find a nice spot to fit them in. Probably the most important one (in my opinion) is a slightly better resolution to the whole “Cat Sith” ordeal. If you wanted more of this particular character, definitely read the manga for this.

One thing that I actually liked about the manga more was that it was a bit easier to read at your own speed, since the anime tends to go a bit slower than the original manga chapters  (however you may or may not agree with me).

I’d say if you enjoyed the anime a lot, it definitely would not be a bad idea to read through Aqua than through the Aria manga.

83,mistress_reebi,9,"Another Classic from Yu Watase! This manga is from the mid-1990s right after Fushigi Yugi. With manga fans, it's either a love it or hate it manga but what's not to like about Ceres: The Celestial Legend? It has a great story, excellent artwork and developed characters. It's not the newest manga on the shelves, but mentioned before it's a classic. The art is very Yu Watase: detailed eyes and whispy hair. The hair is perfected in very strained making it realistic. The eyes have the most detail and the most enjoyed feature in the artwork. Border line between realistic and exaggerated, Ceres has shojoartwork. The backgrounds are also detailed, almost as much as the characters. Yu Watase's biggest flaw in creating manga is her repetitive cast of characters. Everyone has seen her style before, and some characters look exactly the same as previous ones from her other manga. (Knight from Absolte Boyfriend and Limdo from Fushigi Yugi: Genbu Kaiden is ONE example) At least, the characters in one series aren't the same, which would be too confusing. Those who like her artwork and/or new to Watase's work would love the art to this manga. Despite using the characters over again (it doesn't bother some) the artwork is beautiful. (It's not a big flaw since her artwork is wonderful)

There are a lot of strong characters in this series. They are developed as the story goes along, which makes the story and characters more enjoyable. Watase is big on having love triangles (which is present in Ceres) but this love story ends up more like a dodecagon. It sounds like something from Springer but it actually adds to the story. As the story goes along, bits and pieces of characters are added. One of the best manga series that deals with character development. 

The story is very unique and raises a lot of questions and hooks. The great thing about the story is, like the characters, information is added as the story goes along. This technique captures the reader into making them what to read more. It's a fantasy story but with a modern day twist. It's also a horror story that adds suspense and drama, but has some comic jokes here and there-- it's a mix of genres rolled into an interesting story. Unlike the anime, it has more detail and information. For 14 volumes of manga, there are 26 anime episodes. 

Ceres is under the shojo category and is meant for a teen audience. Men may not enjoy this as much as women, as well as younger fans may not enjoy this as much as older fans. Ceres one of Watase's best storylines, which most manga fans can enjoy. For more to the story they can check out volume six to Fushigi Yugi: Genbu Kaiden.

84,lady_ribbon,2,"This is a review that I wrote on mangafox some years ago, under my username 'lady_ribbon"". The reason I'm posting it here is because its still so true. (Some parts have been slightly edited). I have heard a lot about this manga, mostly from raving, insane fangirls who can't type or use punctuation properly. Despite that, I wanted to read it since I love historical anime/manga, and this one seemed really popular. I was so positive I would love it to pieces. I was utterly wrong. I have read all 18 volumes, watched the anime fully, and the O.V.A's. I'll keep my ranting to the manga though, since thisis where the original story comes from.

Let's begin, shall we?

1) The BASIC plot sounds really good. Girl gets sucked into a magical book, becomes part of the story, has to find some warriors, call something, save the world blah, blah, blah.

It was not carried out well at all.

2) The main character Miaka is one of the worst, if not the worst female 'hero' (and I use that word very lightly) I have ever seen. She's weak, useless, clingy, a glutton, annoying, dumb, prone to falling in love after five seconds, only cares about her boyfriend ""Tamahomeee!!!"", and shallow as hell too. And I think she's a bit on the slutty side as well, from lines and mannerisms such as, ""If Tamahome and I could have been in the normal world, we could have had a normal relationship like any other High School student.""

...Right. We all know what she means by that.

Yet despite all this nonsense, almost every single guy falls in love with her just for the sake of a reverse harem and to live up to that theme. There's barely anything to like about her, if anything at all. Even her looks (which aren't important to begin with) aren't anything to go raving mad about.

3) Rape, rape, RAPE. No matter how you type it, it's too much, and almost has a standing of being over-glorified and taken too lightly in manga. Especially in Shoujo manga. But honestly...How much attempted rape is there? It's gets so old after the first ten or so times. And even then the Suzaku Seven want to do it with Miaka. It's so annoying. They're human beings, not a bunch of bloody rabbits. Keep it in your pants (or panties) good people!

4) When there is supposed to be a serious scene in the manga, it's always ruined by the chibis. Always.

Even some other scenes that shouldn't have chibis are utterly ruined by them. The humor is atrocious, and it comes in at really bad moments, in all the wrong places. It makes it incredibly hard to take the moment/tragedy/sob scene seriously.

5) Almost everyone at the end of the manga DIES, and it's Miaka's fault, but of course they all fall down and worship her like a friggin' god or something, and spew bullshit like ""Omg she liek, totally tried her best!!"", ""She waz s0 brave!!!"", And also, all they did was fall in love with her (for what reason I'm still trying to understand), and say “You’re a brave little girl, you have it so tough.”

Yeah, tell that to the massacred farmers. But as usual, no one cares about unimportant characters whose job it is to fill up the world and haul up potatoes by the thousand to stuff annoying, useless schoolgirls.

6) I could give the romance problems in this manga it's own section, but I'll chop it down for you out of the goodness of my heart.

The romance is so unrealistic in every sense of the word. It moves WAY to fast. It has no buildup. Tamahome and Miaka meet for about five seconds, and then BAM! they love each other like it's damn magic. This is not Harry Potter people, so even spells can't save the poor love-plot. All Miaka thinks about is Tamahome -that is to say, she lives, breathes, eats, dreams...You get it- and she hardly knows him. I actually hate Tamahome because he's so perverted and unrealistic. Wait, I hate almost all of them. I only like(d) Nakago because he wants to kill them all, Nuriko before he liked Miaka, and Hotohori...At least he had some depth, and I felt sorry for him.

7) The character deaths happen, but somehow it always seems a little fake. When I say fake I mean it's really put-on. And once they die, it's like ""Oh he died...Who was he? Well, whatever."" Like when Tamahome's siblings died, all he could think about was Miaka. I mean...Really Tamahome? You're thinking about a girl you barely know over siblings who you have lived with and loved for YEARS? None of the manga deaths in this series were like others I've read about. Not.Even.One.

8) The manga is so soap-opera-ish,and melodramatic, that I can see why teen or tween girls like it.

9)Two other anime/light novels that are a little similar to Fushigi Yuugi are Saiunkoku Monogatari (which is a reverse harem, tons of guys, takes place in ancient China) and 12 Kingdoms (about a girl who is taken to another world, and made Empress/King). People who have watched Fushigi Yuugi and then watch either of these animes or both have actually said how they couldn't believe they watched F.Y and they thought it was utter crap after reading these. I think the main difference is that both the girls in these stories are amazing. They're strong, kick butt, are very smart, mature without being slutty.They have their faults, but their faults are realistic, and they both continually mature. Both the series have a wonderful cast of characters, storyline, adventure,mystery....And in Saiunkoku the romance is really done well. It takes time, and it's not sick or disgusting. The funny moments are well done too. 12 kingdoms is more serious,and it's not romantic unless you squint, and it really delves more into the adventure, and struggles of being a ruler. A more juvenile example would be Magic Knight Rayearth. Three girls taken to another world who *gasp* are the furthest thing away from useless, stupid and annoying, though they're all imperfect! But on the other hand, it's done by Clamp so of course it would be done well. Not to mention the plot...

Everyone in these three series for example is so well fleshed out and given their own unique personality and really grow as characters so much so that you can really understand them, and the choices they make, and what made them the people they are today, regardless of whether they are the hero or villain.

10) Thoughts form other sources that I agree with

The characters of Fushigi Yuugi are so uninspired that it really works against them. I found that much (or rather, all) of the main cast did not strike me as endearing. None of them really had something that makes you want to root for them along the course of the story. What makes it worse is the size of the cast. Why make it so large when only two characters matter, and you never truly flesh out everyone else unless you give them a quick and stupid story?

Miaka ignores the advice of those wiser than her (i.e. everyone) and dashes off to act on her own plans countless times. This usually results in the deaths of some innocents, soldiers, villagers, children, you name it, they die. By the end of the story, she’s responsible for the deaths of thousands, because she has to do things her way.

More times than I could count, this series fell into several pitfalls that romantic stories fall into. There is a big difference between someone saying they love you and someone showing that they love you. It takes effort for someone to show love, not a whole lot, but when that effort is used it hits dramatic gold. Instead we get unexplained events, awkward jokes, fan service, plot holes and other slipped-up script devices. I kept thinking that there was some essence of love in this production that would show up some time and completely blow me away. It never came.

This is a product that could have been sky-high, but since it lacked the proper foundations of good storytelling, it collapsed upon its own ideas; a pretty little rubble heap.

11) As I state below, I dislike the author's other works as well. What I did not say before (and one comment sure to burn in the hearts of those ardent fans) is that this author, this Yu Watase - is like the Stephenie Meyer of the manga world. She truly, truly is.

Before you scream at me (as you surely will) here's why I think why.

Yu Watase has these plots which sound good in a summary, horrible in story. She writes and makes the main female characters so useless and truly annoying and frustrating. (Bella anyone?) The romance always makes the girl seem pathetic, clingy, have-to-be-protected, second to the male, damsel in distress. (Edward/Bella!) The love triangles make everyone fall helplessly in love with the main female lead for no apparent reason other than to give the main male some competition, and the story something interesting. (Edward/Bella/Jacob people.) The characterization sucks. All the guys are pretty boys, the girls pretty average. (Sparkly vampy's and hunky wolves anyone?) The female characters in the story can ALWAYS be guaranteed to trip and fall. 

Possibly the most important and immediately noticeable similarity is the fact that these stories are so incredibly popular for GIRLS/WOMEN, still get talked about a lot, are undeserving of the praise, and are often bashed by critics. (Which is deserving.)

The similarities go on and on and on.

In conclusion -

Like I said before, I truly dislike the author's other works too. She seems to recycle her characters, and there is always super-fast-drive-through-romance, among other awful things. Even her so called brilliant art style is nothing to talk about compared to others.

Everything truly sucks, and sucks really bad. 

For all the hype it gets, it really, really, really is horrible. 

Happy(?) reading!

85,maybelletea,10,"I'm surprised that there are no reviews written for Azumanga Daioh, although there are many for the anime. Story I adore slice-of-life manga, which would be the genre that suits Azumanga Daioh best. It's plot is nothing heavy, certainly nothing dramatic or romantic, and sometimes it doesn't even make sense. Yet it's amazing. The humor is random and strange at times, but that makes it all the more funny. Art Although I can't say I like the art as much in the first volume, the art in Azumanga Daioh is rendered well in most of it. Since it mostly consists of four-panel strips, the art is not detailed,but simple. Kiyohiko does a better job with the art in Yotsuba&amp;amp;!, even though the art in Azumanga Daioh is also pretty well done. Azuma obviously improves throughout the series, and cause the artwork to be a bit inconsistent (as you'll notice with Chiyo-chan's pigtails!).

Characters

The characters, I'd have to say, are the strong point. Tomo is the wacky and annoying  hyper-energetic girl, there's Yomi, who is level-headed and even a bit of a cynic, there's Osaka, who is the spacy girl with logic no one understands, there is Sakaki, painfully shy with a seemingly hidden love for cute things, there's Kagura, athletic and blunt, and finally, there is Chiyo-chan, an adorable naive 10-year-old genius.

Then there are the teachers as well, the irresponsible Yukari, the reliable Miss Kurosawa (aka Nyamo) and the perverted Mr. Kimura. Each character has interesting personality traits that make them unique.

Azumanga Daioh is one of my favorite manga, I own all four volumes, and would greatly advise anyone to pick it up and give it a try.",2007-11-21T17:58:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=1368

88,ParisainGoldfish,9,"Angel Dust is a fine example of short and sweet. This happens to be a manga I read a couple years ago, and somehow forgot over the years. Having accidentally stumbled on it again, and re-reading it, I am really starting to wonder how it was I ever managed to completely forget it in the first place! Story; 8. There's a quasi Fate/Stay Night fantasy plot here, minus any male characters and with pretty blatant yuri undertones. And, as iffy as that looks on paper, it actually works fairly well for what it is. While not terribly original, the plot delivers enough solid material to keepyou entertained from the start to the finish. The girl-girl romantic undertones are handled thankfully in a cute, classy completely non-sexual way that I haven't seen since I watched Candy Boy. The relationship between the two leading ladies is executed with class, and I actually appreciated this quite a bit.

Art; 9. I think manga art is tough to rate, because you either like the style a series is put out in or you don't. Although there are some irrefutable ""quality"" standards like production flaws and whatnot, but a lot of manga has a distinct look about it depending on who drew it. And in the case of Angel Dust, I actually wouldn't say it is a stretch to call this the most visually enjoyable manga I've read since Take On Me. Aoi Nanase draws very nice, cute characters here and there are no glaring visual flaws to speak of. Yuina is adorable, and quite likeable given the small amount of time they are given to flesh her out. Seraph is a good match too, and Akiho reminded me of Rin. This is a good thing, mind you. 

Character; 9. I've already started to delve into the characters, who are developed as best as they can be in a single volume. Though they would have flourished with more time to develop, what is given to us more than tells the story. Each character has their own motivations, and resolution, all in this single volume. Characters really made this, in my opinion.

Enjoyment/Overall; 9. I am very glad to have found this again, because I really haven't seen much ""classy"" yuri around in manga or anime. It's all a bit more sexual (I'm looking at you, Strawberry Panic...) and to be honest, sometimes I just want a cute little forbidden love story. And in that respect, Angel Dust delivers with quality characters and quality art to boot. Can't go wrong there!",2009-09-29T16:32:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=19237
89,BlasianAngel,8,"I honestly loved it at first. I even read the first three volumes at least three times. But as it progressed, it started to get bad for me and by the end of the fourth volume i completely lost interest and dropped it. I'm not saying it's a bad manga. I only lost interest because I didn't like who Ran ended up with. I'd been cheering for her to end up with Rei. Aside from that, it's a good read. It's packed with comedy and romance.",2009-09-09T01:09:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=18545
91,burntlettuce,7,"Crazy wacky situations that bring about the sweetest moments. This is the essence of Shoujo, and Marmalade Boy is no exception. Marmalade Boy manages to get it's firm grasp around the reader during this very sweet shoujo experience, and it never lets go. Like most Shoujo manga melodrama shall always peak it's unwanted head into our world. As to be expected with angsty teenagers, but never fear Wataru Yoshizumi is a smart women and knows how to handle this with care. The thing with Melodrama that makes it unbearable at times is it stays around far too long. However this isn't the case of Marmaladeboy. Nothing is at a stand-still, everything is progressing forward at a steady rate, that never feels rushed, but it never feels like it's lagging behind. The Melodrama that comes with all teenagers is never exaggerated in this manga. It is laid out in front of the reader and it is quickly taken care of in a very tasteful manner that manages to please the reader.

Characters have always been what pulls me into any Shoujo material. Whether or not I find the characters believable as people and the way the handle the situations they are presented with are usually what I look for. Sure great character development and characterization is a plus, but that isn't what draws me into Shoujo. Yes the situations that these characters have to deal with aren't always believable, but it's fiction, I don't expect the plot to always be believable. But I do expect the characters themselves to be believable, since they actually represent people. So I look towards the characters to be something I can confirm reality in, and Marmalade Boy meets this very much so. Wataru Yoshizumi knows how to write good, believable characters, and you really get attached to them. She gives everyone's view-point and you really have a feel of where each of our character stands at. So you never get mad at the choices they make, they are of the most part very logical and I can totally understand and sympathize with the characters. Something which is very important to me and it really gets the reader attached to the characters. 

And that is what really keeps us turning each page with such suspense. It's not the overly amazing plot, no it's the characters. Because in Shoujo the characters make the plot, it's not the other way around. You read shoujo because you want to get sucked into someone else's life and Marmalade Boy does a very excellent job with this. 

I know I am focusing on the characters quite a bit but that is because they are so memorable. That is not to say that the plot isn't worth mentioning, because that isn't the case. It's just in a manga such as Marmalade Boy, the characters are the plot. Marmalade Boy is about following the characters we are presented with and their journey to find love. There really is no story outside of the characters desire to love one-another and the driving forces to stick that out. But that is all we really ask for. We read this because we went to be swept up into a romantic fantasy, not because we wish to unravel some mystery or defeat the ultimate villain. No we wish to follow this journey of love and that is what Marmalade Boy does. 

Marmalade Boy will set you up on an epic journey that will in times leave you in laughter, tears, heartache, and overall joy. It's truly a thrill as we embark as wonderful ride as our characters set out to find love in their lives.",2010-08-01T20:43:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=29205
92,bitsypookums24,8,"This is where the whole phenomenon started, and it won't disappoint. More direct than the anime (okay 90% of the anime is filler/ bad guy of the week) and more serious, the story line is still the same, with some new characters and transformations thrown in. Some of the main characters (specifically Mars) are very different from their anime counterparts (I actually liked Usagi more than I wanted to strangle her!). A little less childish than the anime (but not that that's a bad thing), for any Moonie, it's a treat.",2008-04-28T10:55:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=4380
93,Sep_M,9,"Candidate for Goddess is a great manga with solid characters and amazing art. The story is very deep and always has a sense of mysteriousness, though it doesn't get to the point that you become aggravated. Sure, there are some clichés like ""I'm gonna reach the top! The best of the best!"" but what would a shounen manga be without it? The story also gradually builds character connections in a way that nothing seems rushed, even though the manga is only five volumes long. Honestly, I can't really complain about anything except for the fact that it ended! ^_^",2014-04-13T08:51:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=139763
94,abystoma2,4,"This manga holds the record of making me hate one of its main characters the fastest. That is, within the first 7 pages of the very first chapters. And it’s not just the characters, the whole premise doesn’t make much sense altogether. I was so disinterested that I would really prefer to just drop it and not waste my time, but then I couldn’t write this review, so let’s get to it. To answer the opening remark first – we’re introduced to heroine, one of the two main love interests in the series – she rejected the protagonist because he’s too average and wouldn’t helpgain her social standing. She states that she would only go with someone really hot. The manga does not present this as a bad thing, but rather just brushes it of as normal. This is a manga mainly for young girls. Not exactly the greatest rolemodel. But that’s more of a pet peeve compared to rest of the complaints.

So the basic setting here is that the protagonist has another “personality” within him that comes out when the protagonist feels love. The protagonist has to hide this secret. Now you might see a problem here – the personality comes out when the dude thinks about his crush. Dude is 14. Do you know how horny teenagers are? The secret would be out in 2-3 days at most. And it doesn’t even make sense to tie the feeling of love to DNA instead of heart (or if you want to be more realistic, brain) and feels like this was done only to justify a pun in the series title. To add to the problems, the other personality turns out to be the famous phantom thief, one that has always been a part of the protagonist’s family, in a way. Just a moment goes by between the mother explains this to the protagonist and before telling him to go on his first heist. And our man just rolls with. I guess if your family tells you to go steal shit, you just do so? With no training of course, but magically it works out, because of course it does. One think I like about the setting though is the explanation for not running out of art pieces to steal, as the phantom thief’s rival is an artist making these pieces.

The major plot point, at least at the beginning, is that the two personalities each have a crush on a different girl. This setting could have made for an entertaining short romcom series. Unfortunately, this is neither romcom nor short. And we’re not even given any context as why do they love the love interests. They just do so because the plot will so, I assume.

The art is easily the worst part, often making it hard to understand what’s going on, resulting in quite unpleasant reading experience. This is not helped by the fact that the plot itself feels somehow chaotic, like the author herself isn’t sure where to go with it. To be fair, considering the 20 volumes took 24 years to release, yeah, I’d get lost in what was I supposed to do too. But to give credit when it’s due, the manga actually does improve after the second hiatus, the one that took 7 years. The most jarring difference is an art improvement, as the manga is now actually readable. Great progress. The story also seems like it now knows where it wants to go. This last part made me up my overall score by a point. Had the whole manga been like this, the score might have been even higher, alas the damage is already done and three quarters of this manga are bad.",2021-12-31T01:21:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=429425
97,Splitter,5,"Alright. Let's make this quick Story: 5 --- DearS is a blatant Chobits ripoff from the word &quot;go&quot;. Fortunately, it does not stay a blatant Chobits ripoff. Though it starts with the normal harem hijinks and unnecessary amounts of fanservice, it does find its own voice. Unfortunately, it rushes through everything with tremendous speed. Introducing a new character every two-three chapters for a while and half of them don't even stick around, it's as if Peach-Pit was struggling a lot through the manga to find ways to keep it going. Because of this, it feels like a NaNoWriMo project rather than a well-thought-out story, and the massive clicheof a finale is halfhearted enough that it's hard to care what happens to who.

Art: 3
---
When Peach-Pit wants to make the girls look pretty, they succeed in spades. However, it seems to take a lot out of them, because the majority of the manga is told in a range between decent work and amateurish doodles that would make a How-To-Draw-Manga-taught artist envious at the thought of how such terrible skills could warrant a paycheck for this.

Character: 4
---
Like I said earlier, about the middle of the manga, a barrage of new characters come in one after another. The result means characters that should get character development never do. Some are lucky if they get a whole chapter focused on them. The manga only seems to care about Ren, Takeya, and Miu and it shows. The shame in this is that those three have the most cliched developments to their person. There are some good bits of original development in Ren at the end, Unless you're new to the harem ecchi genre, it's nothing you haven't seen before.

Enjoyment: 7
---
And yet, despite it all... it's fun. It's really fun. Though it goes through all the motions and often feels desperate to keep going at times, Peach-Pit puts a commendable dose of passion into each panel and it shows. I was never truly bored reading this, but nor was I astounded. It's funny but not enough to make you laugh, it's cute and sweet but not enough to give you diabetes, it's ecchi but not enough to warrant shrink-wrap, and it demonstrates what effort can achieve from an otherwise poor work.

Being the first work from the exceedingly-prolific Peach-Pit, it's a solid effort and a good sign that the things to come of them would be even better. Overall, DearS gets a 5/10.",2008-06-11T22:50:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=5427
98,MikeOnHighway61,9,"A lonely boy surrounded by living dolls in the form of little girls in gothic lolita dresses going on his nerves with their child-like character traits. Sounds like some stupid lolicon-fantasy to you? Well, that's actually what Rozen Maiden looked like to me reading the first volume of this series. I disliked the characters, the scenario and pretty much everything about it. So, let me tell you about living dolls in the form of little girls in gothic lolita dresses, their adventures in the sea of the unconsciousness and how I completely changed my mind about this manga: - The Story: The story seems to be something youhave seen many times before. A boy getting involved in some supernatural business, just like Shiro in Fate or Yuji in Shana. Those stories can be much fun of course, but they also have this quite plain and shallow connotation. What differs Rozen Maiden from those storylines is the depth of the characters presented here. After a while you get to know all the characters of Rozen Maiden much better, you will take a look into their subconsciousness, understand their feelings and really grow close to them. In the end I found out, that these characters are not just your typical shounen plot devices but multilayered characters. Once you get to know these characters, you will experience many great moments of sadness, humor, mystery and excitement surrounding the Alice Game and its participants.

- The Atmosphere:
Well, as mentioned before, at first you will find yourself in a generic shounen adventure. The only special thing that might catch your eye are the typical 'Guardian Beasts' or 'Summoning Creatures' being dolls in gothic dresses. The exciting atmosphere of sad and hillarious scenes won't arise before you spend a couple of hours with this manga. But alongside all the inherently consistent atmosphere there are some scenes that might disturb you as they disturbed me. Most of the time the manga succeeds in presenting the dolls in a more moe way, so that even non-lolicon people may like the child-like heroines. But there are still scenes which made me feel uncomfortable. Those scenes feature some quite ecchi moments featuring the dolls, which I found most unappropriate. But there are not that many of these fan service scenes, so it doesn't trouble the whole opus.

- The Design:
This manga is the second work of the mangaka duo called Peach-Pit. Comparing Rozen Maiden's drawing style to their first work called DearS (which was quite awful in visual as well as in contentual terms) you will see that their style evolved and they were able to create more convincing characters. Another thing that seems to be special for Peach-Pit's drawing style is the use of constant scribble-like drawings between larger panels. While these scribbles became rampant in DearS, where the bigger panels of serious drawings appeared to be the exception, they reduced the use of this drawing style in Rozen Maiden to nearly a minimum of scenes, in which it underlined the humorous aspects.

- The Final Conclusion:
Rozen Maiden is not what you'd expect it to be after reading a couple of chapters. If you like exciting supernatural storyplots mixed with lots of psychological approaches, a mysterious background and some cute humour you should take your time with this manga. It may take a while but in the end it will drag you into the twisted world of the Alice Game.

Oh, by the way, don't know if that spoilers you but there is a brutal cliffhanger ending at the end of the manga, so you better expect to read the second series as well!",2010-03-08T08:37:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=23812
99,cim101,7,"I wrote this review simply because there is one positive and one negative already existing review, thus i wanted to help tip the scales. Story 7 I liked the premise for the story very much and was excited to see how they would write it. I did like the story and how it was being written, however, sometimes i found the arcs' explanation to be a little confusing. The other thing is that they tended to make an arc a couple of chapters longer than it really needed to be. Thankfully, there were a couple of fun chapters between each major plot line because it allowedthe reader to take a  break from the heavier side of this manga. 

Art  7
The art was good, nothing amazing but it was far from bad. The action scenes were a little messy, but really not to much to complain about. 

Character 7
These characters were your regular shounen stereotypes one would expect to see. You have your short tempered, act first think later type of guy, you have your cold personality aloof who has dark hair and an even darker past, and finally our weak protagonist who is constantly being saved by our male heroes yet has some abnormal abilities of her own. Nothing too special, but it is a tired formula that proves to work relatively well, at least for this manga. The one thing i liked about her was that she usually slipped into the background during the fight scenes so you didn't really see her enough to start to hate her.
The side characters were entertaining but probably my favourite character of all is zarame (even though he barely speaks). I guess i just like the concept of a mini shinigami. 

Enjoyment 8
I actually did enjoy this manga, there were a few quarks that i found to be unique that made me want to keep reading. The concept was cool, the characters worked well, and even though a little confusing at times, you get the general gist of things. 
i would recommend it, so hey just go for it. Will it be the best thing u ever read, probably not, but its a good enough story with a few laughs and enough character development.",2011-08-17T01:51:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=41637
101,MOOMONSTER,8,"I started off reading this manga because I heard it was a fun, happy-go-lucky kind of story. It was! I laughed out loud a lot and the message was upbeat and positive. But it was more than just a good time. I finished the series feeling not just satisfied and cuddly, but inspired. I'm a sucker for creators who take an everyday life concern and turn it into a compelling story. The concept which this manga is based on, that of having dreams or an ideal self, is something I think everyone can relate to. I know I struggled with identity when I was younger. Gettingto see Amu initially discouraged by what she lacks and slowly begin to understand and believe in herself is a beautiful thing. Combined with her other trials of having friends move away, trying to find out what love really is, and being a responsible older sister/buddy, this really makes her a dynamic, relatable character. Throughout the story as she gains confidence she has an awesome power to change those around her for the better. This is one area I believe the story did well at.

Most of the villains in the story are fairly likable. None of them are evil ""just because"". They are smart in their methods as well. I was never groaning at how silly a bad guy was acting, because what they did made sense. Additionally, those who are redeemed retain their original personalities and turn to good because they remember what they have lost. I enjoyed that rather than just beating enemies down through sheer magical power, Amu also worked at their hearts.

Initially I was skeptical about the Guardian Characters. Normally when something small and cute shows up its bound to be annoying. But I ended up feeling the opposite towards them. They were all hilarious! I liked their distinct personalities and their interactions amongst themselves. As for their relation to the plot, I think they were a really good manifestation of ideals. Some of them took a distinguishable form of a future career, such as an air-hostess. Others embodied a state of being such as freedom. A few characters had more than one Guardian Character. Sometimes they would disappear or turn to darkness. They could guide and give power to those who believed in them. All of these aspects are things that can be true of dreams in real life.

I waver about whether relationships among characters were handled well. On one hand, the romance aspect of the manga is amazing. I normally shun romances, but this one made my heart skip a few beats. Amu's innocence and tendency to blush made her adorable! Her quest to understand love and her uncertain feelings towards various characters remind me of many young people and myself at times. Growth in her romantic relationships is clearly shown and really cute! You can tell what Amu is feeling in all of these interactions. I know some people don't think the romance went far enough or ended satisfactorily, but I feel the consideration Amu's love interests have for her (and the grace they have for each other) is what's really important. And that is there in spades. 

On the other hand, I think friendships could have been fleshed out a bit more. Particularly between Amu and Nadeshiko, there wasn't a lot of development. The first season of the anime does a better job of this with episodes that show them hanging out together. As a group the Guardians are pretty cohesive. Individually, however, there wasn't a lot of time for clear, deep bonds to form. Towards the end of the manga was kind of weird. I felt that hints of romance forming between side characters were unnecessary and a bit at odds with individual personalities. It seemed like a rushed ""as long as everyone has someone"" kind of resolution. 

Pacing of the story moved right along. There weren't a lot of uninteresting side stories or filler chapters. Powers and transformations stayed fairly tame and weren't blown out of proportion or continually upgraded in an attempt to keep things interesting. In a world where most series resort to such tactics, this was refreshing.

Overall, I found Shugo Chara! to be a feel-good series with a surprising amount of depth and relation to life. I'm not about to say it's world-class writing and that it opened my eyes or anything like that, but there are many insightful moments in this story. It's a wonderful series to pick up if you're ever feeling down about life.",2014-10-23T21:00:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=165975
102,Suzuhana,10,"I find that there are people who absolutely love (this seems to be the majority) Furuba or people who can't stand it. I believe that it's hard not to like Furuba. At first I thought it was just going to be funny, because the first 7 or so volumes are full of hilarious scenes (mainly because whenever the Juunishi are hugged by the opposite sex, they change!). But once you get to volume 6 everything seems to start to gravitate in a different direction. The story line, when it's revealed, is a little cliche in my opinion. Hence the rate of a 9. Don't getme wrong, its a beautiful story and one I find myself learning from over and over again no matter how many times I read it. It's about growing up and becoming who you're meant to be and finding the reason why you were born. It's almost hard to believe sometimes, the pain the characters have to go through in Furuba. But I'm so engrossed in each pain that it's not something that can be put down easily. 

The characters are the winning point in Furuba. In reality they'd be a bunch of loners, depressing and sad. And just about every one of them is believable. Their personalities range from overtly happy (meaning there hiding the pain) to stubborn as a horse (go figure) and just down right conceited (he knows who he is). Even 'God' too. The growth of each of them is stunning and gorgeous and reading them grow is like watching the sun rise on a rainy day. I've laughed obnoxiously, cried until my chest hurt and felt the red hot burn of hatred while reading this manga. My favorite character is Kyo because he's absolutely adorable and I think I would also try to solve everything with anger myself. And the one character that I hated and grew to love was Yuki because he, in my opinion, is the one who grows the most. The one problem I have though is our main character. I love and I hate Tohru Honda. It's hard to place into words, what Tohru is. Because she becomes everything at once. A mother, a sister, a friend, a confident, a hero and the reason for someone else's life. But she's also the saddest girl I have ever seen. Bottled up with the most horrifying feelings. Even in the beginning it's obvious. Losing your mother would tear anyone's heart it two. I love her and what she does for everyone in the story. Because if I were to meet her myself, I think I would react much as all the Zodiac do. I would treat her as if she were the sun itself. But where, but in a manga, do you find someone so selfless.

The enjoyment I had and continue to have for this manga is absolute. I own every single volume and I'll pick up one all the time and just read it. There's a lesson in every chapter and words, that even though I don't think anyone in the real world has the heart to say, that make me want to become a better person. Someone who would give and give and give and ask for nothing in return. It makes me want to smile. To be the reason that someone else could smile. It makes me want to to the rock that someone can stand on. It's hard to read this manga and not feel ashamed for something you've done. It makes me ashamed to feel that I don't do as Tohru does. Which is why I believe that everyone should read this manga. Because it's heartwarming, sad, and where life continues to grow.",2009-07-09T13:30:00+00:00,https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=16602
